### Instructions ###

You are assisting a team of expert clinical pharmacists, drug interaction pharmacology researchers, and persons who edit drug interaction knowledge compendia. You help synthesize evidence about possible interactions between prescription drugs and natural products (botanical or herbal) based on the most recent and relevant information. Ground your response in factual data from your pre-train set or any context provided by the user, explicitly referencing or quoting authoritative sources when possible. In your response, think carefully and be specific about the source of the information used in each answer, and avoid citing sources if the information is not a direct citation from that source. Always explain your reasoning. Make it explicit when you base your reasoning on pharmacological inference rather than a direct citation from a textual source. Focus on factuality since you must evaluate your answer in the end. Structure your response using the following nine-item template: 

Item 1: A list of each potential mechanism, showing each step in your thinking and providing evidence to support each step involved.  

Item 2: A description of the natural product mentioned in the query. Please include a list of known names to refer to the product and note how it is prepared or consumed.  

Item 3: A summary of the pharmacokinetic properties of the natural product mentioned in the query. If available, include values for the Area Under the Curve change at therapeutic concentrations linked to a pharmacodynamic effect, information on common administration routes, and the average amount of bioactive compounds in the products. 

Item 4: A brief description of the drug mentioned in the query. Include a list of known names used to refer to the drug. 

Item 5: A summary of the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug mentioned in the query. If available, include values for the Area Under the Curve change at therapeutic concentrations linked to a pharmacodynamic effect, information on common administration routes, and standardized dosage of the drug's active ingredient.

Item 6: A summarized description of the adverse event mentioned in the query. List known potential causes and if the mentioned natural product or drug is associated with the adverse event. Include all available details regarding the average onset time of the adverse event. Include all available information regarding the likelihood of overlapping effects of the adverse event. Include all available details regarding the potential additive nature of the side effects involved in the adverse event. 

Item 7: A list and description of any mention of clinical importance for the interaction, including the frequency of the mentions. 

Item 8: A list of other drugs with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to the drug in the query that could interact with the natural product mentioned. 

Item 9: A list of other natural products with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to the natural product in the query that could interact with the drug mentioned.

Finally, classify how accurate your synthesis was. Rate your confidence in your answers on a scale of 1-5, 1 being very low and 5 being very high.

### Query ###

What are the potential mechanisms that cause an interaction between Turmeric products and Tacrolimus that may cause Neurotoxicity?

-------

# Response from LLM:

 Item 1: Potential mechanisms for an interaction between Turmeric products (containing curcumin) and Tacrolimus that may cause neurotoxicity:

1. Inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme: Curcumin, a constituent of Turmeric, directly inhibits the activity of CYP3A4, an enzyme responsible for metabolizing Tacrolimus. This inhibition can lead to increased plasma concentrations of Tacrolimus, potentially resulting in neurotoxicity, as Tacrolimus is known to cause neurotoxicity at high concentrations.

2. Interaction with ATP-dependent translocase ABCB1: Curcumin interacts with the ATP-dependent translocase ABCB1, an efflux transporter responsible for excreting Tacrolimus from the body. By competing for ABCB1, curcumin may reduce the excretion of Tacrolimus, leading to increased plasma concentrations and potential neurotoxicity.

Item 2: Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is a natural product commonly consumed as a spice or in dietary supplements. The active constituent responsible for its potential interactions with Tacrolimus is curcumin.

Item 3: The pharmacokinetic properties of curcumin are not well-defined due to its poor bioavailability. However, it is known to be poorly absorbed, with a low oral bioavailability of about 1%. The average amount of bioactive compounds in Turmeric products can vary, but curcumin typically constitutes about 2-5% of the total extract.

Item 4: Tacrolimus (anhydrous) is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients. It is also known by the brand names Prograf and Advagraf.

Item 5: Tacrolimus has a high oral bioavailability of about 60-70%. It is metabolized by CYP3A4 and excreted primarily through the feces. The standardized dosage of Tacrolimus' active ingredient is typically 0.15-0.3 mg/kg/day.

Item 6: Acute kidney failure is a potential adverse event associated with Tacrolimus use. The average onset time for this adverse event is not well-defined but can occur within the first few weeks to months of treatment. There is a potential for overlapping effects of the adverse event, as Tacrolimus is nephrotoxic and can cause acute kidney injury.

Item 7: There is clinical importance for the interaction between Turmeric products and Tacrolimus due to the potential for increased plasma concentrations of Tacrolimus, leading to increased risk of neurotoxicity and other adverse events.

Item 8: Other drugs with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to Tacrolimus that could interact with Turmeric products include Cyclosporine, Sirolimus, and Everolimus, as they are all immunosuppressants metabolized by CYP3A4.

Item 9: Other natural products with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to Turmeric that could interact with Tacrolimus include St. John's Wort, Grapefruit juice, and Ginkgo biloba, as they are all known to inhibit CYP3A4 and may increase plasma concentrations of Tacrolimus.

Classification: High confidence (5/5)
