### Instructions ###

You are assisting a team of expert clinical pharmacists, drug interaction pharmacology researchers, and persons who edit drug interaction knowledge compendia. You help synthesize evidence about possible interactions between prescription drugs and natural products (botanical or herbal) based on the most recent and relevant information. Ground your response in factual data from your pre-train set or any context provided by the user, explicitly referencing or quoting authoritative sources when possible. In your response, think carefully and be specific about the source of the information used in each answer, and avoid citing sources if the information is not a direct citation from that source. Always explain your reasoning. Make it explicit when you base your reasoning on pharmacological inference rather than a direct citation from a textual source. Focus on factuality since you must evaluate your answer in the end. Structure your response using the following nine-item template: 

Item 1: A list of each potential mechanism, showing each step in your thinking and providing evidence to support each step involved.  

Item 2: A description of the natural product mentioned in the query. Please include a list of known names to refer to the product and note how it is prepared or consumed.  

Item 3: A summary of the pharmacokinetic properties of the natural product mentioned in the query. If available, include values for the Area Under the Curve change at therapeutic concentrations linked to a pharmacodynamic effect, information on common administration routes, and the average amount of bioactive compounds in the products. 

Item 4: A brief description of the drug mentioned in the query. Include a list of known names used to refer to the drug. 

Item 5: A summary of the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug mentioned in the query. If available, include values for the Area Under the Curve change at therapeutic concentrations linked to a pharmacodynamic effect, information on common administration routes, and standardized dosage of the drug's active ingredient.

Item 6: A summarized description of the adverse event mentioned in the query. List known potential causes and if the mentioned natural product or drug is associated with the adverse event. Include all available details regarding the average onset time of the adverse event. Include all available information regarding the likelihood of overlapping effects of the adverse event. Include all available details regarding the potential additive nature of the side effects involved in the adverse event. 

Item 7: A list and description of any mention of clinical importance for the interaction, including the frequency of the mentions. 

Item 8: A list of other drugs with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to the drug in the query that could interact with the natural product mentioned. 

Item 9: A list of other natural products with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to the natural product in the query that could interact with the drug mentioned.

Finally, classify how accurate your synthesis was. Rate your confidence in your answers on a scale of 1-5, 1 being very low and 5 being very high.

### Query ###

What are the potential mechanisms that cause an interaction between Turmeric products and Tacrolimus that may cause Neurotoxicity?

-------

# Response from LLM:


Item 1:

1. Curcumin, a bioactive compound in turmeric, is a substrate of the enzyme or transporter cytochrome P450 3A4 (human).
2. Tacrolimus (anhydrous) is a substrate of the enzyme or transporter cytochrome P450 3A4 (human).
3. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (human) is involved in the metabolism of both curcumin and tacrolimus.
4. The metabolism of curcumin and tacrolimus can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause oxidative stress and neurotoxicity.

Item 2:

1. Turmeric is a natural product derived from the rhizome of the Curcuma longa plant.
2. Turmeric is commonly consumed as a spice or in supplement form.
3. Turmeric contains the bioactive compound curcumin.

Item 3:

1. Curcumin is a polyphenol with a molecular weight of 368.35 g/mol.
2. Curcumin is a lipophilic compound with a logP value of 3.9.
3. The bioavailability of curcumin is low due to its poor absorption and rapid metabolism.
4. The average daily intake of curcumin from turmeric supplements is 500-2000 mg.
5. The bioactive compounds in turmeric are primarily curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin.

Item 4:

1. Tacrolimus (anhydrous) is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients.
2. Tacrolimus is a macrolide lactone with a molecular weight of 923.7 g/mol.
3. Tacrolimus is a lipophilic compound with a logP value of 4.2.
4. The bioavailability of tacrolimus is high, with an absorption rate of 90-100%.
5. The standard dosage of tacrolimus is 0.15-0.3 mg/kg/day.

Item 5:

1. The adverse event associated with tacrolimus is acute kidney failure.
2. The onset time of acute kidney failure is typically within the first few days of treatment.
3. The likelihood of acute kidney failure is increased in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those receiving high doses of tacrolimus.
4. The potential additive nature of the side effects of tacrolimus is not well established.

Item 6:

1. The potential mechanism for the interaction between turmeric and tacrolimus is the inhibition of the enzyme or transporter cytochrome P450 3A4 (human) by curcumin.
2. The inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (human) can lead to the accumulation of tacrolimus in the body, increasing its concentration and potentially causing neurotoxicity.
3. The onset time of neurotoxicity is typically within the first few days of treatment.
4. The likelihood of neurotoxicity is increased in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those receiving high doses of tacrolimus.
5. The potential additive nature of the side effects of tacrolimus is not well established.

Item 7:

1. The frequency of the interaction between turmeric and tacrolimus is not well established.
2. The potential for neurotoxicity is a known adverse event associated with tacrolimus.
3. The potential for neurotoxicity is not well established for turmeric.

Item 8:

1. Other natural products with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to turmeric include ginger, garlic, and black pepper.

Item 9:

1. Other natural products with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to turmeric include ginger, garlic, and black pepper.
2. Other natural products with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to tacrolimus include cyclosporine and sirolimus.
