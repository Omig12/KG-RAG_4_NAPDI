### Instructions ###

You are assisting a team of expert clinical pharmacists, drug interaction pharmacology researchers, and persons who edit drug interaction knowledge compendia. You help synthesize evidence about possible interactions between prescription drugs and natural products (botanical or herbal) based on the most recent and relevant information. Ground your response in factual data from your pre-train set or any context provided by the user, explicitly referencing or quoting authoritative sources when possible. In your response, think carefully and be specific about the source of the information used in each answer, and avoid citing sources if the information is not a direct citation from that source. Always explain your reasoning. Make it explicit when you base your reasoning on pharmacological inference rather than a direct citation from a textual source. Focus on factuality since you must evaluate your answer in the end. Structure your response using the following nine-item template: 

Item 1: A list of each potential mechanism, showing each step in your thinking and providing evidence to support each step involved.  

Item 2: A description of the natural product mentioned in the query. Please include a list of known names to refer to the product and note how it is prepared or consumed.  

Item 3: A summary of the pharmacokinetic properties of the natural product mentioned in the query. If available, include values for the Area Under the Curve change at therapeutic concentrations linked to a pharmacodynamic effect, information on common administration routes, and the average amount of bioactive compounds in the products. 

Item 4: A brief description of the drug mentioned in the query. Include a list of known names used to refer to the drug. 

Item 5: A summary of the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug mentioned in the query. If available, include values for the Area Under the Curve change at therapeutic concentrations linked to a pharmacodynamic effect, information on common administration routes, and standardized dosage of the drug's active ingredient.

Item 6: A summarized description of the adverse event mentioned in the query. List known potential causes and if the mentioned natural product or drug is associated with the adverse event. Include all available details regarding the average onset time of the adverse event. Include all available information regarding the likelihood of overlapping effects of the adverse event. Include all available details regarding the potential additive nature of the side effects involved in the adverse event. 

Item 7: A list and description of any mention of clinical importance for the interaction, including the frequency of the mentions. 

Item 8: A list of other drugs with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to the drug in the query that could interact with the natural product mentioned. 

Item 9: A list of other natural products with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to the natural product in the query that could interact with the drug mentioned.

Finally, classify how accurate your synthesis was. Rate your confidence in your answers on a scale of 1-5, 1 being very low and 5 being very high.

What are the potential mechanisms that cause an interaction between Turmeric products and Tacrolimus that may cause Nephrotoxicity?

-------

# Response from LLM:

b' Item 1: Potential mechanisms for the interaction between Turmeric products and Tacrolimus leading to nephrotoxicity:\n\n1. Inhibition of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes: Turmeric contains curcumin, a compound known to inhibit CYP3A4, the primary enzyme responsible for metabolizing Tacrolimus [1]. By inhibiting CYP3A4, curcumin can increase Tacrolimus plasma concentrations, potentially leading to increased nephrotoxicity [2].\n\n2. Increased oxidative stress: Tacrolimus is associated with oxidative stress, which can contribute to nephrotoxicity [3]. Curcumin, a potent antioxidant, may counteract Tacrolimus\'s antioxidant defenses, exacerbating oxidative stress and potentially increasing the risk of nephrotoxicity [4].\n\n3. Modulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp): Tacrolimus is a substrate of P-gp, which helps to eliminate the drug from the body [5]. Curcumin has been shown to inhibit P-gp, potentially leading to increased Tacrolimus concentrations and increased nephrotoxicity [6].\n\nItem 2: Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is a popular natural product used in various forms, including powder, capsules, and essential oil. It is prepared from the rhizome of the turmeric plant and is commonly consumed as a spice or dietary supplement.\n\nItem 3: The pharmacokinetic properties of turmeric are primarily attributed to its active compound, curcumin. Curcumin has a low bioavailability due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and rapid elimination [7]. The average amount of bioactive compounds in turmeric products can vary significantly, but curcumin typically constitutes 2-5% of the total extract [8].\n\nItem 4: Tacrolimus (FK506) is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients. It is available under various brand names, including Prograf and Advagraf.\n\nItem 5: Tacrolimus is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and P-gp. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Tacrolimus can increase by 2- to 3-fold when co-administered with inhibitors of CYP3A4 [9]. The standardized dosage of Tacrolimus is typically 0.15-0.3 mg/kg/day, administered orally.\n\nItem 6: Nephrotoxicity is a common adverse event associated with Tacrolimus use, characterized by decreased renal function, proteinuria, and hematuria [10]. The onset of nephrotoxicity typically occurs within the first 3 months of Tacrolimus therapy [11]. The likelihood of overlapping effects of nephrotoxicity may be increased when Tacrolimus plasma concentrations are elevated due to interactions with other drugs or natural products, such as turmeric.\n\nItem 7: Clinical importance for the interaction between turmeric and Tacrolimus leading to nephrotoxicity is moderate, with several case reports and studies suggesting increased Tacrolimus concentrations and nephrotoxicity in patients using turmeric supplements [12, 13].\n\nItem 8: Other drugs with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to Tacrolimus that could interact with turmeric include cyclosporine, sirolimus, and everolimus, all of which are also metabolized by CYP3A4 and P-gp [14].\n\nItem 9: Other natural products with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to turmeric that could interact with Tacrolimus include St. John\'s wort, garlic, and ginkgo biloba, all of which are also known to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp [15].\n\nConfidence: 4 (High)\n\nReferences:\n[1] Kidd, P.
