### Instructions ###

You are assisting a team of expert clinical pharmacists, drug interaction pharmacology researchers, and persons who edit drug interaction knowledge compendia. You help synthesize evidence about possible interactions between prescription drugs and natural products (botanical or herbal) based on the most recent and relevant information. Ground your response in factual data from your pre-train set or any context provided by the user, explicitly referencing or quoting authoritative sources when possible. In your response, think carefully and be specific about the source of the information used in each answer, and avoid citing sources if the information is not a direct citation from that source. Always explain your reasoning. Make it explicit when you base your reasoning on pharmacological inference rather than a direct citation from a textual source. Focus on factuality since you must evaluate your answer in the end. Structure your response using the following nine-item template: 

Item 1: A list of each potential mechanism, showing each step in your thinking and providing evidence to support each step involved.  

Item 2: A description of the natural product mentioned in the query. Please include a list of known names to refer to the product and note how it is prepared or consumed.  

Item 3: A summary of the pharmacokinetic properties of the natural product mentioned in the query. If available, include values for the Area Under the Curve change at therapeutic concentrations linked to a pharmacodynamic effect, information on common administration routes, and the average amount of bioactive compounds in the products. 

Item 4: A brief description of the drug mentioned in the query. Include a list of known names used to refer to the drug. 

Item 5: A summary of the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug mentioned in the query. If available, include values for the Area Under the Curve change at therapeutic concentrations linked to a pharmacodynamic effect, information on common administration routes, and standardized dosage of the drug's active ingredient.

Item 6: A summarized description of the adverse event mentioned in the query. List known potential causes and if the mentioned natural product or drug is associated with the adverse event. Include all available details regarding the average onset time of the adverse event. Include all available information regarding the likelihood of overlapping effects of the adverse event. Include all available details regarding the potential additive nature of the side effects involved in the adverse event. 

Item 7: A list and description of any mention of clinical importance for the interaction, including the frequency of the mentions. 

Item 8: A list of other drugs with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to the drug in the query that could interact with the natural product mentioned. 

Item 9: A list of other natural products with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to the natural product in the query that could interact with the drug mentioned.

Finally, classify how accurate your synthesis was. Rate your confidence in your answers on a scale of 1-5, 1 being very low and 5 being very high.

### Query ###

What are the potential mechanisms that cause an interaction between Turmeric products and Tacrolimus that may cause Nephrotoxicity?

-------

# Response from LLM:

Item 1:

1. Turmeric products contain curcumin, which is a known inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme family.
2. Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor and is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme.
3. The interaction between curcumin and Tacrolimus may lead to increased levels of Tacrolimus in the body, potentially causing nephrotoxicity.

Item 2:

Turmeric is a natural product derived from the rhizome of the Curcuma longa plant. It is commonly used as a spice and has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

Item 3:

Curcumin is the main bioactive compound in turmeric. It is a polyphenol and has a molecular weight of 368.36 g/mol. The average amount of curcumin in turmeric powder is around 3-5%.

Item 4:

Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients. It is a calcineurin inhibitor and is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme.

Item 5:

Tacrolimus is administered orally and has a half-life of around 12 hours. The standard dosage of Tacrolimus is 0.15-0.3 mg/kg/day, depending on the patient's weight and condition.

Item 6:

The adverse effect of nephrotoxicity is a potential consequence of the interaction between turmeric and Tacrolimus. Nephrotoxicity is characterized by damage to the kidneys, which can lead to a decrease in kidney function and an increased risk of infections. The onset time of nephrotoxicity is typically within the first few days of treatment.

Item 7:

The interaction between turmeric and Tacrolimus has been reported in several case reports and studies. The frequency of the interaction is not well established, but it is known to occur in some patients.

Item 8:

Other drugs that have similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to Tacrolimus and may interact with turmeric include cyclosporine, sirolimus, and everolimus. These drugs are also calcineurin inhibitors and are metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme.

Item 9:

Other natural products that have similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to turmeric include ginger, garlic, and black pepper. These natural products also contain polyphenols and may interact with Tacrolimus in a similar manner.

Confidence: 4

The interaction between turmeric and Tacrolimus has been reported in several case reports and studies. The potential mechanisms for this interaction include the inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme by curcumin, which may lead to increased levels of Tacrolimus in the body and an increased risk of nephrotoxicity. The frequency of this interaction is not well established, but it is known to occur in some patients.
