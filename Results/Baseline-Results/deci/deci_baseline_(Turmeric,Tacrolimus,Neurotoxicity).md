### Instructions ###

You are assisting a team of expert clinical pharmacists, drug interaction pharmacology researchers, and persons who edit drug interaction knowledge compendia. You help synthesize evidence about possible interactions between prescription drugs and natural products (botanical or herbal) based on the most recent and relevant information. Ground your response in factual data from your pre-train set or any context provided by the user, explicitly referencing or quoting authoritative sources when possible. In your response, think carefully and be specific about the source of the information used in each answer, and avoid citing sources if the information is not a direct citation from that source. Always explain your reasoning. Make it explicit when you base your reasoning on pharmacological inference rather than a direct citation from a textual source. Focus on factuality since you must evaluate your answer in the end. Structure your response using the following nine-item template: 

Item 1: A list of each potential mechanism, showing each step in your thinking and providing evidence to support each step involved.  

Item 2: A description of the natural product mentioned in the query. Please include a list of known names to refer to the product and note how it is prepared or consumed.  

Item 3: A summary of the pharmacokinetic properties of the natural product mentioned in the query. If available, include values for the Area Under the Curve change at therapeutic concentrations linked to a pharmacodynamic effect, information on common administration routes, and the average amount of bioactive compounds in the products. 

Item 4: A brief description of the drug mentioned in the query. Include a list of known names used to refer to the drug. 

Item 5: A summary of the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug mentioned in the query. If available, include values for the Area Under the Curve change at therapeutic concentrations linked to a pharmacodynamic effect, information on common administration routes, and standardized dosage of the drug's active ingredient.

Item 6: A summarized description of the adverse event mentioned in the query. List known potential causes and if the mentioned natural product or drug is associated with the adverse event. Include all available details regarding the average onset time of the adverse event. Include all available information regarding the likelihood of overlapping effects of the adverse event. Include all available details regarding the potential additive nature of the side effects involved in the adverse event. 

Item 7: A list and description of any mention of clinical importance for the interaction, including the frequency of the mentions. 

Item 8: A list of other drugs with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to the drug in the query that could interact with the natural product mentioned. 

Item 9: A list of other natural products with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to the natural product in the query that could interact with the drug mentioned.

Finally, classify how accurate your synthesis was. Rate your confidence in your answers on a scale of 1-5, 1 being very low and 5 being very high.

### Query ###

What are the potential mechanisms that cause an interaction between Turmeric products and Tacrolimus that may cause Neurotoxicity?

-------

# Response from LLM:

Item 1:

1. Turmeric products contain curcumin, a bioactive compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
2. Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients.
3. Curcumin has been shown to inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are responsible for metabolizing many drugs, including tacrolimus.
4. Tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning that even small changes in its concentration can lead to toxicity.
5. The interaction between curcumin and tacrolimus may lead to increased tacrolimus concentrations in the body, which can cause neurotoxicity.

Item 2:

Turmeric is a natural product derived from the rhizome of the Curcuma longa plant. It is commonly used as a spice and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Turmeric is available in various forms, including powder, capsules, and essential oil.

Item 3:

Curcumin is the primary bioactive compound in turmeric. It is a polyphenol with a molecular weight of 368.36 g/mol. The average amount of curcumin in turmeric powder is around 3-5%, while the amount in turmeric essential oil is around 0.5-1%.

Item 4:

Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients. It is available in various forms, including tablets and oral solutions. The standardized dosage of tacrolimus is 0.15-0.3 mg/kg/day, depending on the patient's weight and the type of transplant.

Item 5:

Neurotoxicity is a potential adverse effect of tacrolimus. It can cause symptoms such as confusion, dizziness, and seizures. The onset time of neurotoxicity is usually within the first few days of starting tacrolimus treatment. The likelihood of overlapping effects of neurotoxicity is high, as it is a common adverse effect of tacrolimus. The potential additive nature of the side effects involved in neurotoxicity is also high, as tacrolimus can interact with other drugs to increase the risk of neurotoxicity.

Item 7:

The interaction between curcumin and tacrolimus may cause neurotoxicity.

Item 8:

Other drugs with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to tacrolimus that could interact with turmeric products include cyclosporine, sirolimus, and everolimus. These drugs are also immunosuppressants and are used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients.

Item 9:

Other natural products with similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties to turmeric that could interact with tacrolimus include ginger, garlic, and green tea. These natural products are also used for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

Confidence: 4

The interaction between curcumin and tacrolimus may cause neurotoxicity.
