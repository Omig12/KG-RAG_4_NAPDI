Lithium
For mention of a case of lithium toxicity in a woman who had been taking a non-prescription herbal diuretic containing corn silk, Equisetum hyemale, juniper, buchu, parsley and bearberry, all of which are believed to have diuretic actions, see under Parsley + Lithium, page 305. Note that this case was with Equisetum hyemale, which is not the species more commonly used (Equisetum arvense).
