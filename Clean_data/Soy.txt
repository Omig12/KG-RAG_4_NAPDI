Antibacterials
No data for soya found. For the theoretical possibility that broadspectrum antibacterials might reduce the metabolism of the isoflavone constituents of soya, such as daidzein, by colonic bacteria, and so alter their efficacy, see Isoflavones + Antibacterials, page 302.

Caffeine
Soya products may increase the metabolism of caffeine.

Levothyroxine and related drugs
Soya products or soya isoflavones might increase the dose required of thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

MAOIs or RIMAs
A potentially fatal hypertensive reaction can occur between the non-selective MAOIs and tyramine-rich foods. Significant amounts of tyramine may be present in fermented or preserved soya products such as soy sauce and tofu, and it may be prudent to avoid these while taking an MAOI. Effects may last for up to two weeks after discontinuation of the MAOI. However, other soya products such as dried textured soya protein and fresh soya beans are unlikely to contain important amounts of tyramine. The risk of a serious hypertensive reaction with moclobemide (or other RIMAs) is very much reduced. Most patients therefore do not need to follow the special dietary restrictions required with the non-selective MAOIs.

Nicotine
For discussion of a study showing that soya isoflavones (daidzein and genistein) caused a minor decrease in the metabolism of nicotine, see Isoflavones + Nicotine, page 303.

Paclitaxel
No data for soya found. For the possibility that genistein, an isoflavone present in soya, might markedly increase paclitaxel levels, see Isoflavones + Paclitaxel, page 303.

Tamoxifen
No data for soya found. For the possibility that high doses of daidzein present in soya might modestly increase theophylline levels, see Isoflavones + Theophylline, page 304.

Warfarin and related drugs
Natto, a Japanese food made from fermented soya bean, can markedly reduce the effects of warfarin and acenocoumarol, because of the high levels of vitamin K2 substance produced in the fermentation process. In one study, soya bean protein also modestly reduced the effects of warfarin, and a similar case has been reported with soy milk. Two cases of ‘warfarin resistance’ have been seen in patients given intravenous soya oil emulsions.
