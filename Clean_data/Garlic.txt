Antiplatelet drugs
Garlic may have antiplatelet properties. It might therefore be expected to increase the risk of bleeding with conventional antiplatelet drugs and other drugs that have antiplatelet adverse effects.

Herbal medicines; Caffeine containing
Garlic did not interact with caffeine, page 200, and is therefore unlikely to interact with caffeine-containing herbs, as a result of this constituent.

Herbal medicines; Fish oil
Garlic supplements and fish oils may have beneficial effects on blood lipids.

Studies in healthy subjects found that garlic did not affect the pharmacokinetics of single-dose paracetamol to a clinically relevant extent.

Protease inhibitors
A garlic supplement reduced the plasma levels of saquinavir in one study, but had little effect in another. Another garlic supplement did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of ritonavir.

Warfarin and related drugs
An isolated report described increases in the anticoagulant effects of warfarin in two patients taking garlic supplements. Another report described a decrease in anticoagulant effects of fluindione in a patient taking garlic tablets. Garlic supplements alone have also rarely been associated with bleeding. However, in one study, aged garlic extract did not increase the INR or risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin.
