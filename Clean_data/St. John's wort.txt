5-Aminolevulinic acid
An isolated case report describes a severe phototoxic reaction attributed to a synergistic effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid and St John’s wort.

Anaesthetics, general
It has been predicted that St John’s wort may prolong the effects of anaesthetics, which is supported by an isolated case. A case of profound hypotension during anaesthesia following the longterm use of St John’s wort has also been reported. The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends that all herbal medicines should be stopped two weeks prior to elective surgery.

Antidiabetics
St John’s wort modestly decreases the AUC of gliclazide and rosiglitazone. Pioglitazone and repaglinide are similarly metabolised and may therefore be expected to interact similarly. St John’s wort does not affect the metabolism of tolbutamide.

Antiepileptics
St John’s wort modestly increased the clearance of single-dose carbamazepine, but had no effect on multiple-dose carbamazepine pharmacokinetics. Carbamazepine does not appear to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of hypericin or pseudohypericin (constituents of St John’s wort). St John’s wort increased the clearance of mephenytoin by about 3-fold and is predicted to reduce the blood levels of phenytoin and phenobarbital, but this awaits clinical confirmation.

Benzodiazepines
Long-term use of St John’s wort decreases the plasma levels of alprazolam, midazolam and quazepam. St John’s wort preparations taken as a single dose, or containing low-hyperforin levels, appear to have less of an effect.

Bupropion
St John's wort negligibly reduces the exposure to bupropion. A single case describes dystonia when bupropion was started in a patient taking HRT and St John's wort. A case of mania was attributed to the use of St John's wort in a patient taking bupropion.
