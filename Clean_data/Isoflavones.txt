Tamoxifen
The available evidence on the effect of isoflavone supplements on the efficacy of tamoxifen in breast cancer is inconclusive, and the effect of isoflavones on breast tissue appears to be complex. It is possible that whether the effect is beneficial or antagonistic might be related to the dose of isoflavones used, and also the oestrogen status of the patient (pre- or postmenopausal).
