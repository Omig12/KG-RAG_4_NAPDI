Ciclosporin
Occasional consumption of cranberry juice does not appear to affect the bioavailibility of ciclosporin. Regular daily consumption has not been studied.

Flurbiprofen
Limited evidence suggests that cranberry juice does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of flurbiprofen.

Tizanidine
Limited evidence suggests that cranberry juice does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.

Warfarin and related drugs
A number of case reports suggest that cranberry juice can increase the INR of patients taking warfarin, and one patient has died as a result of this interaction. Other patients have developed unstable INRs or, in one isolated case, a reduced INR. However, in four controlled studies, cranberry juice did not alter the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, or had only very minor effects on the INR. Neither cranberry juice nor the extract altered warfarin pharmacokinetics.
