Anticoagulants
The INR of one patient taking warfarin modestly increased after he took Curbicin (saw palmetto, cucurbita and vitamin E). This product has also been associated with an increased INR in a patient not taking anticoagulants. Excessive bleeding during surgery has been reported in another patient who had been taking saw palmetto.
