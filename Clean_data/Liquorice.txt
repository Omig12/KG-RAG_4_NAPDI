Antihypertensives
Liquorice may cause fluid retention and therefore reduce the effects of antihypertensives. Additive hypokalaemia may also occur with loop and thiazide diuretics.

For mention that sho-saiko-to (of which liquorice is one of 7 constituents) only slightly reduced the metabolism of caffeine in one study, see Bupleurum + Caffeine, page 99.

Carbamazepine
For mention that sho-saiko-to (of which liquorice is one of 7 constituents) did not affect the metabolism of carbamazepine in an animal study, see Bupleurum + Carbamazepine, page 99.

Cilostazol
A case report describes a case of pseudoladosteronism which was attibuted to an interaction between glycyrrhizin and cilostazol.
