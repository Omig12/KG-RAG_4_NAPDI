The β-O-linked glycosides (sennosides) are not absorbed in the upper gut; they are converted by bacteria of the large intestine into the active metabolite (rhein anthrone). There are two different mechanisms of action: (1) Stimulation of the motility of the large intestine resulting in accelerated colonic transit. (2) Influence on secretion processes by two concomitant mechanisms viz. inhibition of absorption of water and electrolytes (Na+, Cl- ) into the colonic epithelial cells (antiabsorptive effect) and increase of the leakiness of the tight junctions and stimulation of secretion of water and electrolytes into the lumen of the colon (secretagogue effect) resulting in enhanced concentrations of fluid and electrolytes in the lumen of the colon. Defaecation takes place after a delay of 8-12 hours due to the time taken for transport to the colon and metabolisation into the active compound.","The β-Ο-linked glycosides (sennosides) are neither absorbed in the upper gut nor split by human digestive enzymes. They are converted by the bacteria of the large intestine into the active metabolite (rhein anthrone). Aglycones are absorbed in the upper gut. Animal experiments with radio-labeled rhein anthrone administered directly into the caecum demonstrated absorption <10%. In contact with oxygen, rhein anthrone is
oxidised into rhein and sennidins, which can be
found in the blood, mainly in the form of
glucuronides and sulphates. After oral
administration of sennosides, 3-6% of the
metabolites are excreted in urine; some are
excreted in bile.
Most of the sennosides (ca. 90%) are excreted in
faeces as polymers (polyquinones) together with
2-6% of unchanged sennosides, sennidins, rhein
anthrone and rhein. In human pharmacokinetic
studies with senna pods powder (20 mg
sennosides), administered orally for 7 days, a
maximum concentration of 100 ng rhein/ml was
found in the blood. An accumulation of rhein was
not observed.
Active metabolites, e.g. rhein, pass in small
amounts into breast milk. Animal experiments
demonstrated that placental passage of rhein is
low.","There are no preclinical data available for senna leaves or preparations thereof. It can be assumed that data obtained with senna pods can be transferred to senna leaf preparations. In a 90-day rat study, senna pods were administered at dose levels from 100 mg/kg of up to 1500 mg/kg (human equivalence dose of 16- 242 mg/kg). In all groups epithelial hyperplasia of the large intestine of minor degree was found and was reversible within the 8-week recovery period. The hyperplastic lesions of the forestomach epithelium were reversible as well. Dosedependent tubular basophilia and epithelial hypertrophy of the kidneys were seen at a dose of, or greater than 300 mg/kg per day without functional affection. These changes were also reversible. Storage of a brown tubular pigment led to a dark discoloration of the renal surface and still remained to a lesser degree after the European Union herbal monograph on Senna alexandrina Mill.

Cascarosides A and B are mixed anthrone-C- and O-glycosides, Cascarosides C, D, E and F are 8-Oβ-D-glucosides, which are largely not split by human digestive enzymes in the upper gut and therefore not absorbed to a large extent.

However, in the case of senna, animal experiments with radio-labeled rheinanthrone administered directly into the caecum show that only a very small proportion (less than 10%) of rhein-anthrone is absorbed. Active metabolites, such as rhein, pass in small amounts into breast milk. Animal experiments demonstrated that placental-passage of rhein is low.","There are limited preclinical data on cascara bark preparations but details are lacking. Cascara bark (140 and 420 mg/kg: no further details provided) did not induce the development of colonic aberrant crypti foci (ACF, considered a consistent predictor of tumour outcome) and tumours and did not modify the number of azoxymethane-induced ACF and tumours in both doses in rats treated for 13 weeks (alone or in combination). Dietary exposure of rats (0.05% and 0.1% of the diet) of the anthraquinone glycosides of cascara for 56 successive days did not cause appearance of ACF: However, the higher dosage increased the incidence of ACF induced by 1,2-dimethyl-hydrazine in rats. Studies with emodin (a constituent of cascara bark preparations) revealed effects on oestrus cycle length and nephropathy in mice. Furthermore, several hydroxyl anthracene derivatives were mutagenic and genotoxic in several in vitro test systems, however this was not proven in in vivo systems. In long term carcinogenicity studies effects on kidneys and colon/caecum were reported. Reproductive toxicity seen was connected to maternal toxicity due to diarrhoeal effects."

Several pyrrolizidine alkaloids and pyrrolizidine alkaloid derivatives have been shown to produce genotoxic effects in cell cultures after metabolic activation. In rats, after oral administration appropriately low repeated doses of several alkaloids have been shown to induce tumours and in some studies, a single dose has been carcinogenic. In rats, after oral application of the pyrrolizidine alkaloid lasiocarpine given at doses of 35 mg/kg during pregnancy, foetal hepatotoxicity was observed.

Eubacterium sp. strain BAR) into the active anthrone compounds, mainly aloe-emodin-9- anthrone. It is not known to what extent aloeemodin-9-anthrone is absorbed. However, in the case of senna, animal experiments with radiolabelled rhein-anthrone administered directly into the caecum show that only a very small proportion (less than 10%) of rhein-anthrone is absorbed. Systemic metabolism of free anthranoids depends on their ring constituents. In the case of aloeemodin, it has been shown in animal experiments that at least 20-25% of an oral dose is absorbed. The bioavailability of aloe-emodin is much lower than the absorption, because it is quickly oxidised to rhein and unknown metabolites, or conjugated. After administration of other anthranoids, active metabolites, such as rhein, pass in small amounts into breast milk. Animal experiments demonstrated that placental-passage of rhein is low.","There are no preclinical tests available for aqueous extracts from aloe or similar preparations. Studies with emodin (a major constituent of Aloes folii succus siccatus) revealed effects on oestrous cycle length in rats and nephropathy in mice. Furthermore several hydroxyl anthracene derivatives were mutagenic and genotoxic in several in vitro test systems, however this was not proven in in vivo systems. In long term carcinogenicity studies effects on kidneys and colon/caecum were reported. Reproductive toxicity seen was connected to maternal toxicity due to diarrhoeal affects."

Concomitant use with diuretics, adrenocorticosteroids and liquorice root may enhance loss of potassium.",,,,,"Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions (pruritus, urticaria, local or generalised exanthema) may occur. Gastrointestinal disorders: Frangula bark may produce abdominal pain and spasm and passage of liquid stools, in particular in patients with irritable colon. However, these symptoms may also occur generally as a consequence of individual overdosage. In such cases dose reduction is necessary. Furthermore, chronic use may cause pigmentation of the intestinal mucosa (pseudomelanosis coli), which usually recedes when the patient stops taking the preparation. Kidney and urinary tract symptoms: Long term use may lead to water and electrolyte imbalance and may result in albuminuria and haematuria. Yellow or red-brown (pH dependent) discolouration of urine by metabolites, which is not clinically significant, may occur during the treatment. The frequencies are not known. If other adverse reactions not mentioned above occur, a doctor or a pharmacist should be consulted.","The major symptoms of overdose/abuse are griping pain and severe diarrhoea with consequent losses of fluid and electrolytes. Treatment should be supportive with generous amounts of fluid. Electrolytes, specifically potassium, should be monitored. This is particularly important in the elderly. Chronic ingested overdoses of anthranoid containing medicinal products may lead to toxic hepatitis.","Pharmacotherapeutic group: contact laxatives Proposed ATC-code: A06AB 1.8-dihydroxyanthracene derivatives possess a laxative effect. Glucofrangulins and frangulins are respectively Odiglycosides and O-monoglycosides, which are largely (all β-O-glycosides) not split by human digestive enzymes in the upper gut and therefore not absorbed to large extent. They are converted by the bacteria of the large intestine into the active metabolite (emodin-9-anthrone). There are two different mechanisms of action: 1. Stimulation of the motility of the large intestine resulting in accelerated colonic transit. 2. Influence on secretion processes by two concomitant mechanisms: (i) inhibition of absorption of water and electrolytes (Na+, Cl- ) into the colonic epithelial cells (anti-absorptive effect) and (ii) increase of the leakiness of the tight junctions and stimulation of secretion of water and electrolytes into the lumen of the colon (secretagogue effect) resulting in enhanced concentrations of fluid and electrolytes in the lumen of the colon. Defaecation occurs after a delay of 8-12 hours following laxative intake due to the time taken for transport to the colon and metabolisation into the active compound.","The β-O-linked glycosides are not split by human digestive enzymes and therefore not absorbed in the upper gut to large extent. They are converted by the bacteria of the large intestine into the active metabolite (emodin-9-anthrone). Mainly anthraquinone aglycones are absorbed and transformed into their corresponding glucuronides and sulphate derivatives. Rhein, emodin and traces of chrysophanol are found in human urine after oral administration of frangula bark extract. Active metabolites, such as rhein, pass in small amounts into breast milk. Animal experiments demonstrated that placental-passage of rhein is low.","There are no preclinical tests available on frangula bark preparations. In the in vitro salmonella/microsome mutagen test and the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair test of primary rat hepatocytes emodin and frangulin, an alcoholic extract of “Rhamnus frangula”, and a commercial frangula bark preparation showed a dose-dependent increase in the mutation rate or the induction of DNA repair. Studies with emodin (a constituent of frangula bark preparations) revealed effects on oestrus cycle length and nephropathy in mice. Furthermore, several hydroxyl anthracene derivatives were mutagenic and genotoxic in several in vitro test systems, however this was not proven in in vivo systems. In long term carcinogenicity studies effects on kidneys and colon/caecum were reported. The reproductive toxicity observed was linked to maternal toxicity due to diarrhoeal effects."

Available studies with warfarin do not indicate that there is an interaction between warfarin and G. biloba products, but adequate monitoring is advised when starting, when changing G. biloba dose, when ending G. biloba intake or if changing product. An interaction study with talinolol indicates that G. biloba may inhibit P-glycoprotein at the intestinal level. This may give rise to increased exposure of drugs markedly affected by P-glycoprotein in the intestine such as dabigatran etexilate. Caution is advised if combining G. biloba and dabigatran. One interaction study has indicated that the Cmax of nifedipine may be increased by G biloba. In some individuals, increases by up to 100% were observed resulting in dizziness and increased severity of hot flushes. Concomitant use of G. biloba preparations and efavirenz is not recommended; plasma concentrations of efavirenz may be decreased because of induction of CYP3A4 (see also section 4.4).

Peak plasma concentrations of terpene lactones were in the range of 16-22 ng/ml for ginkgolide A, 8-10 ng/ml for ginkgolide B and 27-54 ng/ml of bilobalide when given as tablets. The corresponding halflives of ginkgolide A and B and bilobalide were 3- 4, 4-6 and 2-3 hours, respectively. 120 mg G. biloba extract given as solution peak plasma concentrations were 25-33 ng/ml, 9-17 ng/ml and 19-35 ng/ml for ginkgolide A, B and bilobalide, respectively. The related half-life for ginkgolide A was 5 hours, for ginkoglide B 9-11 hours and for bilobalide 3-4 hours.

The results showed only for dogs a low toxicity in the highest dosage group. Reproductive toxicity Only limited information is available on reproductive toxicity of the Ginkgo biloba dry extract. The published data are contradictory. While an older study in rats and rabbits and a newer study in mice revealed no teratogenic, embryotoxic or adverse reproductive effects, another study in mice showed effects on reproductive parameters, such as fertility and reproductive performance and it evoked vaginal bleeding. Also tests with unspecified or slightly different Ginkgo extracts pointed towards effects on fetal development (with and without maternal toxicity) or caused subcutaneous bleeding, hypopigmentation, growth inhibition and anophthalmia in chicken embryos. Adequate tests on reproductive toxicity do not exist. Mutagenicity, carcinogenicity Tests on genotoxicity and carcinogenicity are not available for the Ginkgo biloba dry extract. An extract similar to the monograph relevant extract was tested in a series of studies for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. It was positive for gene mutation in bacteria. A peripheral mouse erythrocytes micronucleus test provided a negative result in male and an equivocal result in female animals. The thyroid gland tumours found in a rat carcinogenicity study and hepatocellular carcinoma found in a mouse carcinogenicity study are considered rodent specific, non-genotoxic response associated (with long-term treatment) with high doses of hepatic enzyme inducers. These types of tumours are not considered relevant to humans. The extract did not induce measurable genotoxic effects in mice up to 2000 mg/kg.

Subchronic treatment causes a down-regulation of -adrenergic receptors; it changes the behaviour of animals in several antidepressant models (e.g., forced swimming test) similarly to synthetic antidepressants. Napthodianthrones (e.g. hypericin, pseudohypericin), phloroglucin derivatives (e.g. hyperforin) and flavonoids contribute to the activity.

Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.","The absorption of hypericin is delayed and starts about 2 hours after administration. The elimination half-life of hypericin is about 20 hours, the mean residence time about 30 hours. Maximum hyperforin levels are reached about 3-4 hours after administration; no accumulation could be detected. Hyperforin and the flavonoid miquelianin can cross the blood-brain-barrier. Hyperforin induces the activity of the metabolic enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and PGP dose-dependently via activation of the PXR system. Therefore the elimination of other drug substances may be accelerated, resulting in decreased plasma concentrations.

No signs of mutagenicity could be detected in further in-vitro and in-vivo test systems. Tests on reproductive toxicity revealed equivocal results. Tests on the carcinogenic potential have not been published. Phototoxicity: After oral application of dosages of 1800 mg of an extract per day for 15 days the skin sensitivy against UVA was increased, and the minimum dose for pigmentation was significantly reduced. In the recommended dosage, no signs of phototoxicity are reported.

Following feeding of dams with 100 mg 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid/kg/day commencing on the 13th day of gestation, on the 17th, 19th and 21st days of gestation the maternal plasma 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid concentrations were approximately 100 µg/ml, whereas the foetal concentrations were 5, 18 and 32 µ/ml, respectively. In developmental toxicity studies, glycyrrhizin (ammonium salt) exhibited some embryotoxicity to the developing rat foetus, but the foetal effects were considered as minor. These effects were shown at the dose of 100 and 250 mg/kg of ammonium glycyrrhizin from 7th to 20th day of pregnancy (soft-tissue abnormalities, mostly renal, and external haemorrhages) and at the dose of 1000 mg/kg of 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid from the 13th day of gestation (significant reduction in lamellar body content of lungs and reduced number alveolar lamellar body and surfactant clusters, but no apparent increase in malformation or foetal death rate). Another study suggested that 100 mg/kg of liquorice extract repeated for 7 days may also aggravate body weight loss and malformations of foetuses, induced by intrauterine exposure to cyclophosphamide."

Several studies in healthy subjects or patients
indicate that peppermint oil given intraluminally
(stomach or colon) or orally exert spasmolytic
action on the smooth muscles of the
gastrointestinal tract.
Peppermint oil appears to enhance production of
bile. The choleretic and antifoaming effects of
peppermint oil may play an additional role to the
antispasmodic action, decreasing the abdominal
distension, as well as the discomfort and
abdominal pain.
In systematic reviews and meta-analyses,
placebo-controlled studies indicate that
peppermint oil shows improvement of abdominal
pain and global IBS symptoms.

Dose-dependent analgesic effects of willow bark dry extract (8-14:1) ethanol 70% were observed in controlled clinical studies in patients with low back pain exacerbations.
Antiphlogistic effects of willow bark were studied in vitro (hen’s egg chorioallantoic membrane test, effects on COX-1, COX-2, HLE and 5-LOX, tests on antioxidant effects) and in vivo (rat paw oedema, air pouch, adjuvant-induced arthritis, rithing-test, Randall-Sellito test, brewer’s yeast induced fever reaction).

Peak levels were reached within 2 hours after oral administration.
Peak serum levels of salicylic acid were on average 1.2 mg/l and the AUC was equivalent to that expected from an intake of 87 mg acetylsalicylic acid.

Proposed ATC code: M02AB
Capsaicin is the primary pungent principle in the fruit of capsicum plants. The precise mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated.
Topically applied capsaicin triggers local irritation, which manifests symptomatically as erythema and a burning, sometimes itchy sensation. This may be attributed to a neurogenic inflammatory process and explained by the release of the neurotransmitter substance P.
The second stage of the capsaicin action is associated with antinociceptive effects, the duration of which ranges from hours to weeks.
Substance P depletion of the neuron following repeated application leads to a long-term desensitisation to burning and pain.","Capsaicin is absorbed percutaneously. Animal data suggest a systemic bioavailability of topically applied capsaicin ranging from 27 to 34%.
The absorbed capsaicin is metabolised mainly in the liver and eliminated in the form of metabolites in the urine and faeces.","Herbal preparations:
Preclinical data are incomplete. Tests on reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity do not exist.
Capsaicin:
Acute toxicity of capsaicin in mice was in the order intravenous > intraperitoneal> subcutaneous > oral> dermal indicating that systemic absorption and toxicity following dermal application were lower than after an oral dose. High subcutaneous doses of capsaicin were not teratogenic in rats.
However, there was evidence that capsaicin crosses the placenta and exerts a toxic effect on the peripheral nerves of foetuses, provoking extensive depletion of substance P from immunoreactive nerve fiber from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Prenatal treatment of rats with high subcutaneous doses of capsaicin (50 mg/kg) caused functional neuronal defects; whereas neonatal treatment caused retarded body growth and sexual maturation, decreased mating frequency and reduced gestations.
Published data on potential mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of capsaicin were inconclusive. Capsaicin, in the quantities absorbed cutaneously from the plaster/semisolid dosage form is unlikely to pose any significant hazard to humans."

Proposed ATC code: {A 06 AC 01, C 10 AX}
The active ingredient ispaghula husk consists of the episperm and collapsed adjacent layers removed from the seeds of Plantago ovata Forssk (Plantago ispaghula Roxb.). Ispaghula husk is particularly rich in alimentary fibres and mucilages, its mucilage content being higher than that of other Plantago species. Ispaghula husk is capable of absorbing up to 40 times its own weight in water. Ispaghula husk consists of 85% water-soluble fibre; it is partly fermentable (in vitro 72% unfermentable residue) and acts by hydration in the bowel. Gut motility and transit rate can be modified by ispaghula husk through mechanical stimulation of the gut wall as a result of the increase in intestinal bulk by water and the decrease in viscosity of the luminal contents.
When taken with a sufficient amount of liquid (at least 30 ml per 1 g of herbal substance) ispaghula husk produces an increased volume of intestinal contents due to its highly bulking properties and hence a stretch stimulus, which triggers defecation; at the same time the swollen mass of mucilage forms a lubricating layer, which makes the transit of intestinal contents easier.
Progress of action: Ispaghula husk usually acts as a laxative within 12 to 24 hours after single administration. Sometimes the maximum effect is reached after 2 to 3 days. In mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia a reduction of LDL cholesterol of approximately 7% has been reported. Investigations, which study the effect of ispaghula husk on the incidence of cardiovascular events and total mortality, are not available.","The material hydrates and swells to form a
mucilage because it is only partially solubilised. Polysaccharides, such as those which dietary fibres are made of, must be hydrolysed to monosaccharides before intestinal uptake can occur. The sugar residues of the xylan backbone and the side chains are joined by ß-linkages, which cannot be broken by human digestive
enzymes.

The active ingredient psyllium seed consists of the dried ripe, whole seeds of Plantago afra L. (Plantago psyllium L.) or Plantago indica L. (Plantago arenaria Waldstein and Kitaibel). Psyllium seed is particularly rich in alimentary
fibres and mucilages. Psyllium seed is capable of absorbing up to 10 times its own weight in water. Psyllium seed consists of 10 – 12 % mucilage polysaccharides, which are located in the episperms. It is partly fermentable (in vitro 72 % unfermentable residue) and acts by hydration in the bowel. Gut motility and  ransit rate can be modified by psyllium through mechanical stimulation of the gut wall as a result of the increase in intestinal bulk by water and the decrease in viscosity of the luminal contents or by contact with rough fibre particles. When taken with a sufficient amount of liquid (at least 30 ml per 1 g of herbal substance) psyllium produces an increased volume of intestinal contents due to its highly bulking properties and hence a stretch  stimulus, which triggers defaecation; at the same time the swollen mass of mucilage forms a lubricating layer, which makes the transit of intestinal contents easier.
Progress of action: Psyllium seed usually acts within 12 to 24 hours after single administration. Sometimes the maximum effect is reached after 2 to 3 days.","The material hydrates and swells to form a
mucilage because it is only partially solubilised.

The seeds contain nearly 25 % of bulk materials (3 - 6 % of mucilage, 4 - 7 % of alimentary fibres).
The laxative effects of linseed have long beenrecognised empirically and shown in animal and clinical  investigations. These effects are attributed to the bulk materials and in particular to the mucilage that binds with water and swells to form a demulcent gel in the intestine. Water is held back in the intestine due to the swelling of the mucilage. Faeces become softer. The volume of the intestinal content increases and causes a stretch stimulus, which results in a decrease in transit time. The swollen mass of mucilage forms a lubrication layer facilitating the transit of intestinal content.
Progress of action: Linseed usually acts within 12 to 24 hours. Sometimes the maximum effect is not reached before 2 or 3 days.
Broken seeds do not always cause a stretch stimulus because the increase in volume may already start in the stomach. Whole or “bruised seeds” have a delayed increase in volume. The use in conditions, in which easy defaecation with soft stool is desirable, is scientifically substantiated on the basis of the laxative effects but there are no special data available.
Not required as per Article 16c(1)(a)(iii) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.","One part of the bulk materials in linseed is defaecated, the other part is fermented in the colon by bacteria. This process of fermentation can produce gas and flatulence. The predominant products of fermentation are short chain fatty acids (SCFA), which are mainly resorbed.
