Anxiolytics
The interaction between berberine and anxiolytics is based on"
experimental evidence only.

Ciclosporin
Berberine appears to increase the bioavailability and trough blood levels of ciclosporin. Animal studies suggest that ciclosporin may affect the intestinal absorption and elimination of berberine possibly by inhibiting P-glycoprotein.
