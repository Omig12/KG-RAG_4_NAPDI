Oestrogens or Oestrogen antagonists
Chinese angelica may contain oestrogenic compounds. This may result in additive effects with oestrogens or it may oppose the effects of oestrogens. Similarly, Chinese angelica may have additive effects with oestrogen antagonists or oppose the effects of oestrogen antagonists (e.g. tamoxifen).
