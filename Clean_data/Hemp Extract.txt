Alcohol
The detrimental effects of drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis might be additive on some aspects of driving performance. However, there is some evidence that regular cannabis use per se does not potentiate the effects of alcohol. Smoking cannabis can alter the bioavailability of alcohol.

Amfetamines
Cannabis opposes the stimulant effect of ecstasy, but long-term users of both drugs may potentially experience cumulative CNS impairment and addititive immunomodulation. The effects of ecstacy and ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol on heart rate may be additive and ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol may prolong te hyperthermic effects of ecstasy. A report describes severe arterialischaemia in a patient who regularly abused amfetamines and cannabis. The concurrent use of amfetamines and synthetic cannabinoids may lead to adverse cardiac effects.
