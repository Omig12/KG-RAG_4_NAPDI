Tamoxifen and other oestrogen antagonists
Ginseng may contain oestrogenic compounds that might directly stimulate breast cancer growth and oppose the actions of competitive oestrogen receptor antagonists such as tamoxifen. However, there is some evidence that ginseng use before diagnosis might not adversely affect breast cancer survival.

Tolbutamide
For conflicting evidence that sho-saiko-to (of which ginseng is one of 7 constituents) might increase or decrease the rate of absorption of tolbutamide in animal studies, see Bupleurum + Tolbutamide, page 99.

Warfarin and related drugs
One pharmacological study found that Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) modestly decreased the effect of warfarin, whereas another study found that Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) did not alter the effect of warfarin. Two case reports describe decreased warfarin effects, one with thrombosis, attributed to the use of ginseng (probably Panax ginseng).
