"GinkgoGinkgo bilobaL. (Ginkgoaceae)Synonym(s) and related speciesFossil tree, Kew tree, Maidenhair tree.Salisburia adiantifoliaSm.,Salisburia bilobaHoffmanns.PharmacopoeiasGinkgo (USP 32); Ginkgo capsules (USP 32); Ginkgo dryextract, refined and quantified (BP 2009,Ph Eur 6.4);Ginkgo leaf (BP 2009,Ph Eur 6.4); Ginkgo tablets (USP32); Powdered ginkgo extract (USP 32).ConstituentsGinkgo leaves contain numerousflavonoidsincluding thebiflavone glycosides such as ginkgetin, isoginkgetin,bilobetin, sciadopitysin, and also some quercetin andkaempferol derivatives.Terpene lactonesare the othermajor component, and these include ginkgolides A, B andC, and bilobalide, Ginkgo extracts may be standardised tocontain between 22 and 27%flavonoids(flavone glycosides)and between 5 and 12% terpene lactones, both on the driedbasis. The leaves contain only minor amounts of ginkgolicacids, and some pharmacopoeias specify a limit for these.The seeds contain ginkgotoxin (4-O-methylpyridoxine)and ginkgolic acids.Use and indicationsThe leaves of ginkgo are the part usually used. Ginkgo isoften used to improve cognitive function in cases ofdementia and memory loss, and it has been investigatedfor use in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Theginkgolides are thought to possess antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory properties and it has been used for cerebro-vascular and peripheral vascular disorders, tinnitus, asthmaand to relieve the symptoms of altitude sickness.Ginkgo seeds contain some toxic constituents; neverthe-less, they are used in China and Japan, including as a food.PharmacokineticsThe two main active components of ginkgo are flavonoidsand terpene lactones. For information on the pharmacoki-netics of individual flavonoids present in ginkgo, see underflavonoids, page 186. In contrast to the flavonoids, thebioavailability of ginkgolide A and B (but not C) andbilobalide is relatively high and a large proportion of thedose is excreted unchanged in the urine.1The effects of ginkgo on cytochrome P450 isoenzymesappear to have been relatively well studied. It appears thatthe flavonoid fraction of ginkgo has more of an effect on thecytochrome P450 isoenzymes than the terpene lactones,2,3and the effect on these enzymes can be halted relativelyquickly when ginkgo is stopped.4In vitroandratstudies2–5have found that ginkgo mayhave some modest effects on CYP1A2 (see also theophyl-line, page 216). However, evidence from clinical studiesusing the specific probe substrate caffeine suggests that thisis not clinically relevant with therapeutic doses of ginkgo.See Ginkgo + Caffeine, page 211.Similarly,in vitroandratstudies2–4,6–8have suggested thatginkgo affects CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP1E2, but clinicalstudies using the specific probe substrates tolbutamide,page 217, for CYP2C9, dextromethorphan, page 213, forCYP2D6, and chlorzoxazone, page 212, for CYP1E2 havefound no clinically relevant effect.In contrast,in vitrofindings suggesting that ginkgo mayaffect CYP3A42–4,6–9and induce CYP2C92–4,6–8are supportedby clinical studies with midazolam, page 210 and omepra-zole, page 216, respectively. However, the effect of ginkgoon CYP3A4 is unclear (induction and inhibition reported),but any effect appears modest at best.In vitroandratstudies4,6,7also suggest that ginkgo mayaffect CYP2B6 and CYP2C8, but the clinical relevance ofthis needs investigation.Ginkgo is unlikely to affect the activity of P-glycoproteinto a clinically relevant extent (see digoxin, page 213).Interactions overviewGinkgo appears to decrease the levels of omeprazole; itseems likely that most other proton pump inhibitors will besimilarly affected. Some evidence suggests that diltiazemand nifedipine levels may be raised by ginkgo, whereasnicardipine levels may be reduced.Isolated cases of bleeding have been seen when ginkgohas been taken with conventional antiplatelet drugs, antic-oagulants and NSAIDs, and some cases have occurred withginkgo alone, although a clinically relevant antiplatelet effectfor ginkgo alone is not established. Isolated case reports alsosuggest that ginkgo may cause seizures in patients takingphenytoin and/or valproate and one case had decreasedphenytoin and valproate levels. Phenobarbital levels do notappear to be significantly affected, although this is based onexperimental data only. Isolated cases also describe coma ina patient taking trazodone with ginkgo, priapism in a patienttaking ginkgo with risperidone, and CNS depression in apatient taking ginkgo with valerian, although this case isconfused by alcohol consumption.There are someanimaldata suggesting that ciclosporinlevels might be reduced by ginkgo, and it has been suggestedthat the extrapyramidal adverse effects of haloperidol and theototoxic effects of amikacin may be enhanced by ginkgo.Ginkgo does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics/metabolism of alprazolam, caffeine, chlorzoxazone, dextro-methorphan, diclofenac, digoxin, donepezil, fexofenadine,G 207"

"Ginkgo + AminoglycosidesThe interaction between ginkgo and amikacin is based onexperimental evidence only.Clinical evidenceNo interactions found.Experimental evidenceGinkgo 100 mg/kg (EGb 761) daily for 20 days and amikacin600 mg/kg daily for the first 14 days were given torats. Amikacin-induced ototoxicity developed earlier and to a greater level than thatcaused by amikacin given alone. Ginkgo alone did not induceototoxicity.1MechanismUnknown.Importance and managementGinkgo appears to accelerate the appearance of amikacin-inducedototoxicity and to increase its ototoxic effects inrats. Because thedevelopment of ototoxicity is cumulative, if ginkgo accelerates thisprocess, there is potential for ototoxicity to develop at a lowercumulative dose. The available evidence is weak, but until more isknown it may be prudent to carefully consider the risks and benefitsof continuing ginkgo during treatment with drugs such as theaminoglycosides.1.

Amikacin ototoxicity enhanced byGinkgo bilobaextract (EGb 761).Hear Res(2002) 169, 121–9.Ginkgo + AntiepilepticsCase reports describe seizures in three patients taking valproate,or valproate and phenytoin, when ginkgo was also taken.Clinical evidenceA 55-year-old man takingvalproateandphenytoinfor a seizuredisorder that developed following coronary artery bypass surgerysuffered a fatal breakthrough seizure while swimming a year later.Analysis of his medical history showed that he had unexplainedsubtherapeutic serum levels ofvalproateandphenytoinon threeoccasions over the previous year. It was later found that the patienthad also been taking numerous vitamins, supplements and herbalmedicines without the knowledge of his physician, of which aginkgo extract was stated to be the most common ingredient.1Theonly other herbal medicines named in the report were ginseng andsaw palmetto.In another case, a 78-year-old man, whose epileptic seizures hadbeen well controlled byvalproate1.2 g daily for 7 years, suffered acluster of seizures after taking a ginkgo extract 120 mg daily for2 weeks for the management of mild cognitive impairment. Theginkgo was stopped and the patient was reportedly seizure free8 months later. All other medications taken by the patient remainedunchanged.2An 84-year-old epileptic woman with severe dementia takingvalproate1.2 g daily had been seizure free for 2 years. After taking aginkgo extract 120 mg daily for 12 days prescribed by her psych-iatrist, she suffered a cluster of seizures, which were treated withintravenous diazepam in the accident and emergency department.The ginkgo extract was stopped on admission and the patientremained free of seizures 4 months later. All other medications takenby the patient were unchanged.2Experimental evidenceNo relevant data found.MechanismUnknown. Ginkgoseeds(nuts) contain the neurotoxin 4-O-methoxypyridoxine (ginkgotoxin), which indirectly inhibits theactivity of glutamate decarboxylase, which in turn results in seizureinduction by lowering the levels ofγ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Alarge quantity of ginkgo nuts (about 70 to 80) alone have beenreported to be the cause of seizures in a healthy 36-year-old woman.3However, leaf extracts would not generally be expected to containsufficient levels of this neurotoxin to be a problem.Another possible mechanism is induction of the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP2C19 by ginkgo. Phenytoin is a substrate ofCYP2C19 and therefore, in theory, ginkgo may increase themetabolism of phenytoin and thereby reduce its levels. Ginkgo hasbeen seen to induce CYP2C19 in clinical studies. See Ginkgo +Proton pump inhibitors, page 216.Importance and managementEvidence for an interaction between ginkgo and valproate andphenytoin appears to be limited to case reports. The only case thatmeasured serum levels of these antiepileptics is complicated by theuse of numerous other supplements. An interaction is therefore byno means established. Nevertheless, it may be prudent to considerthe possibility of reduced effects if a patient taking phenytoin and/orvalproate wishes also to take ginkgo.For details of a possible interaction between ginkgo andphenobarbital inanimalssee Ginkgo + Phenobarbital, page 215.1.

Generalised convulsions after consuming alarge amount of ginkgo nuts.Epilepsia(2001) 42, 280–1.Ginkgo + Antiplatelet drugsGinkgo biloba has been associated with platelet, bleeding andclotting disorders, and there are isolated reports of seriousadverse reactions after its concurrent use with antiplatelet drugssuch as aspirin, clopidogrel and ticlopidine.Clinical evidenceA study in 10 healthy subjects found no significant increase in theantiplatelet effects of single doses ofclopidogrel75 mg orcilostazol100 mg when a single dose of ginkgo 120 mg was added. However,the bleeding time was significantly increased whencilostazolwascombined with ginkgo, although none of the subjects developed anysignificant adverse effects.1Another study2in 8 healthy subjectsfound that ginkgo 40 mg three times daily had no significant effecton the pharmacokinetics of a single 250-mg dose ofticlopidinetaken on day 4.A randomised, double-blind study in 55 patients with establishedperipheral artery disease (PAD), or with risk factors for developingPAD, found that the addition of ginkgo 300 mg (standardised extractEGb 761) in divided doses toaspirin325 mg daily did not have asignificant effect on platelet aggregation. Five of the patients takingcombined therapy reported nosebleeds or minor bleeding; however,4 patients from theaspirin-only group also reported minor bleeding.3Similarly, a study in 41 healthy subjects found that 120-mg ginkgo-coated tablets (EGb 761) twice daily had no effect on the antiplateletactivity ofaspirin500 mg daily given for 7 days. Minor bleedingwas seen in a few subjects but this was attributed to the use ofaspirin.4In an analysis of supplement use, 23% of 123 patients werecurrently taking supplements, and 4 patients were found to be takingginkgo andaspirin. However, no problems from this use were foundon review of the patients’notes.5Nevertheless, a number of cases of clinically significant bleedinghave been reported. A 70-year-old man developed spontaneousbleeding from the iris into the anterior chamber of his eye withinone week of starting to take a ginkgo supplement (Ginkoba) tabletGinkgo209 G"
"twice daily. He experienced recurrent episodes of blurred vision inone eye lasting about 15 minutes, during which he could see a reddiscoloration through his cornea. Each tablet contained 40 mg ofconcentrated (50:1) extract of ginkgo. He was also takingaspirin325 mg daily, which he had taken uneventfully for 3 years sincehaving coronary bypass surgery. He stopped taking the ginkgo butcontinued with theaspirin, and 3 months later had experienced norecurrence of the bleeding.6Another case reports persistentpostoperative bleeding from a hip arthroplasty wound, whichcontinued despite stoppingaspirin. On closer questioning, thepatient had continued to take ginkgo extract 120 mg dailypostoperatively. The oozing from the wound gradually reducedwhen the ginkgo was stopped.A search of Health Canada’s database of spontaneous adversereactions for the period January 1999 to June 2003 found 21 reportsof suspected adverse reactions associated with ginkgo. Most of theseinvolved platelet, bleeding and clotting disorders. One report of afatal gastrointestinal haemorrhage was associated with ticlopidineand ginkgo, both taken over 2 years along with other medications.Another report was of a stroke in a patient taking multiple drugs,includingclopidogrel,aspirinand a herbal product containingginkgo.7Experimental evidenceGinkgo (EGb 761) 40 mg/kg daily had no effect on the antiplateletactivity ofticlopidine50 mg/kg daily when given toratsfor 3 days.However, when both were given for 5 days, the inhibition of plateletaggregation was double that ofticlopidinegiven alone and thebleeding time was increased by about 60%. Also, when given for9 days, the combination was twice as effective at inhibiting thrombusformation when compared with the same dose ofticlopidinealone.8MechanismThe reason for the bleeding is not known, but ginkgo extractcontains ginkgolide B, which is a potent inhibitor of platelet-activating factorin vitro; this is needed for arachidonate-independentplatelet aggregation. However, in one controlled study in healthysubjects, taking a ginkgo preparation alone for 2 weeks had no effecton platelet function.9Nevertheless, there are case reports of ginkgosupplements, on their own, being associated with prolongedbleeding times,10–12left and bilateral subdural haematomas,10,13aright parietal haematoma,14a retrobulbar haemorrhage,15post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy bleeding16and subarachnoid haemor-rhage.11It seems that the effects of ginkgo and conventionalantiplatelet drugs can be additive, leading to bleeding complicationson rare occasions.Importance and managementThe evidence from these case reports is too slim to advise patientstaking aspirin, clopidogrel or ticlopidine to avoid ginkgo, but somedo recommend caution,7which seems prudent, especially as this isgenerally advised with most combinations of conventional anti-platelet drugs. There may also be a theoretical risk of increasedbleeding if ginkgo is taken with other antiplatelet drugs andanticoagulants; interactions have been reported with NSAIDs, someof which have antiplatelet effects, and with warfarin.Consider also Ginkgo + NSAIDs, page 214 and Ginkgo +Warfarin and related drugs, page 217.1.

Studies with midazolam suggest that ginkgo mayincrease, decrease or have no effect on its metabolism.Clinical evidence(a) AlprazolamGinkgo leaf extract 120 mg twice daily for 16 days was given to 12healthy subjects before and with a single 2-mg dose ofalprazolamon day 14. The ginkgo preparation (Ginkgold) was standardised toginkgo flavonol glycosides 24% and terpene lactones 6%. ThealprazolamAUC was reduced by 17%, and the maximumconcentration was not significantly affected.1(b) MidazolamIn 12 healthy subjects, ginkgo 60 mg four times daily for 28 days didnot affect the metabolism ofmidazolam8 mg. The ginkgo prepar-ation used was stated to contain 24% flavone glycosides and 6%terpene lactones.2These findings were repeated in a later study usingthe same criteria in 12 elderly healthy subjects.3In contrast, inanother similar study, ginkgo 120 mg twice daily modestlyreducedthe AUC and maximum serum levels of a single 8-mg dose ofmidazolamby about one-third. The ginkgo preparation was assayed,and contained 29% flavonol glycosides and 5% terpene lactones.4Furthermore, in yet another study in 10 healthy subjects, ginkgo360 mg daily for 28 daysincreasedthe AUC of a single 8-mg doseof oralmidazolamby about one-quarter. The ginkgo preparationused wasGinkgold, which was stated to contain 24% flavoneglycosides and 6% terpene lactones.5Experimental evidenceIn an experimental study, unfamiliar pairs ofratswere placedtogether in a novel arena for 10 minutes to determine the effects ofcombined administration of ginkgo anddiazepamon socialbehaviour. Social contact betweenratsgiven ginkgo 96 mg/kg(EGb 761) daily for 8 days and then a single injection ofdiazepam1 mg/kg 30 minutes before testing, was significantly higher thanthose given ginkgo ordiazepamalone.6MechanismAlprazolam and midazolam are probe substrates for the cytochromeP450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. The studies here show that ginkgo hasminimal effects on this isoenzyme, the maximum effect onmidazolam being about a 33% reduction in AUC. However, it isunusual for studies to show opposite effects (one of the studies founda minor increase in midazolam AUC), and the reasons for this areunclear, but may be to do with the methodology (use of midazolammetabolic ratios rather than midazolam exposure, and length ofsampling time4and the fact that in one study the subjects hadpreviously received lopinavir/ritonavir for 30 days, concurrentlywith the ginkgo for 2 weeks, just 2 weeks before the midazolam4).210Ginkgo G"
"The reasons for the experimental findings are not understood butginkgo may interact with diazepam through its effects on theγ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor.Importance and managementThe pharmacokinetic evidence here shows that alprazolam andmidazolam levels are not significantly affected by ginkgo, and noclinically relevant interaction would be expected. The conflictingfinding of the metabolism of midazolam being slightly inhibited inone studyandslightly induced in another is, however, unexplained,but either effect would be modest at the most. Alprazolam andmidazolam are used as a probe drugs for CYP3A4 activity, andtherefore these results also suggest that a clinically relevantpharmacokinetic interaction as a result of this mechanism betweenginkgo and other CYP3A4 substrates is unlikely.The clinical relevance of the possible interaction of ginkgo withdiazepam inratsis unknown.1.

The ginkgo prepar-ation used was standardised to 24% flavone glycosides and 6%terpene lactones.1These findings were repeated in a later study usingthe same criteria in 12 elderly healthy subjects.2Experimental evidenceNo relevant data found.MechanismThis study shows that ginkgo has no clinically relevant effect on thecytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2.Importance and managementEvidence from studies in healthy subjects suggests that ginkgo doesnot affect the metabolism of caffeine and is therefore unlikely toincrease its adverse effects. Caffeine is used as a probe drug forCYP1A2 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that apharmacokinetic interaction as a result of this mechanism betweenginkgo and other CYP1A2 substrates is unlikely.1.

Ginkgo 20 mg/kg had no significant effect on thelevels of intravenous diltiazem 3 mg/kg.1MechanismThe authors suggest that ginkgo may inhibit the activity of thecytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein, both ofwhich would raise diltiazem levels by inhibiting its metabolism orincreasing its absorption, respectively.1However, in clinical studies,ginkgo had no clinically relevant effect on the P-glycoproteinsubstrate digoxin, page 213, or on the conventional CYP3A4 probesubstrate, midazolam, page 210.Importance and managementAn interaction between ginkgo and diltiazem has only beendemonstrated in one study inrats,and ginkgo does not appear tohave clinically relevant effects on the activity of P-glycoprotein oron the metabolism of other CYP3A4 substrates such as thebenzodiazepines. Because the findings ofanimalstudies cannot bedirectly extrapolated to humans, further study is needed before anyspecific recommendations can be made. Until more is known, bearthe possibility of an interaction in mind in the event of anunexpected response to treatment.1.

"extract contained 24% flavonoids (12% quercetin) and 9% terpenelactones.MechanismThe authors suggested that ginkgo may induce the cytochrome P450subfamily CYP3A, which would increase the metabolism ofnicardipine, a CYP3A4 substrate, and reduce its levels. However,in contrast, studies with diltiazem, page 211 and nifedipine, belowhave showninhibitionof CYP3A4 and increased levels. Moreover,note also that clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition has not been seewith the conventional CYP3A4 probe substrate, midazolam,page 210.Importance and managementThese experiments inratssuggest that ginkgo can significantlyreduce the levels of nicardipine by inducing CYP3A, but note thatthere is experimental evidence of ginkgo increasing nifedipine anddiltiazem levels. Moreover, clinical studies with CYP3A4 substratessuch as the benzodiazepines, page 210, have not shown anyclinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction. Because of this, andbecause the doses used were higher than those used in humans, theanimaldata here are unlikely to be of general clinical importance.1.

Ginkgo increased the levels of nifedipine byabout 50%.1In another study, a single 240-mg dose of ginkgo extract did notsignificantly affect the pharmacokinetics of a single 10-mg oral doseof nifedipine when they were given at the same time to 8 healthysubjects. However, the maximum level tended to increase (30%increase), and two subjects experienced a doubling of nifedipinemaximum serum levels. In addition, the incidence and severity ofheadaches, hot flushes and dizziness tended to be higher with thecombination when compared with nifedipine alone. Subjects alsoexperienced increased heart rate with the combination although thedecrease in blood pressure was unaffected.2The ginkgo extract usedin this study contained 24% flavonoids and 6% terpene lactones.Experimental evidenceIn a study inrats, ginkgo extract 20 mg/kg increased the maximumserum levels and AUC of an oral dose of nifedipine 5 mg/kg byabout 60% when they were given at the same time.3Ginkgo extracthad no effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous nifedipine.MechanismExperimental data3have found that ginkgo has no significant effecton the pharmacokinetics of intravenous nifedipine, suggesting thatginkgo reduces the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. Ginkgo maytherefore inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, whichwould reduce the pre-systemic metabolism of nifedipine, a CYP3A4substrate, and increase its levels. Note that simultaneous adminis-tration of single doses is probably insufficient to completely evaluateCYP3A4 inhibition. Note also that clinically relevant CYP3A4inhibition has not been seen with the conventional CYP3A4 probesubstrates such as midazolam. See Ginkgo + Benzodiazepines,page 210.Importance and managementLimited clinical data suggest that ginkgo may raise the levels ofnifedipine and increase its effects. Until more is known, somecaution might be warranted when they are used together. Monitor forsigns of nifedipine adverse effects such as headaches, hot flushes,dizziness and palpitations. If they become apparent, advise thepatient to stop taking ginkgo.1. Smith M, Lin KM, Zheng YP.

The ginkgo preparation used was standardised to 24%flavone glycosides and 6% terpene lactones.1These findings wererepeated in a later study using the same criteria in 12 elderly healthysubjects.2Chlorzoxazone is used a probe substrate for the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP2E1, and this study shows that ginkgo has noclinically relevant effect on this isoenzyme. No action is necessarywith combined use, and no pharmacokinetic interaction would beexpected with other substrates of CYP2E1.1.

However, inclinical studies, ginkgo had no clinically relevant effect on the P-glycoprotein substrate digoxin, page 213, or on midazolam,page 210, a CYP3A4 substrate.212Ginkgo G"
"Importance and managementThe evidence for an interaction between ginkgo and ciclosporin islimited to one study inrats. However, ginkgo contains flavonoids,and of these quercetin has been implicated in modest interactionswith ciclosporin in other studies (see Flavonoids + Ciclosporin,page 190 for more information). On this basis, while there isinsufficient evidence to suggest that concurrent use should beavoided, there is the possibility that ginkgo may make ciclosporinlevels less stable as the quercetin content of different preparations islikely to vary. Some caution might therefore be prudent onconcurrent use.1. Yang CY, Chao PDL, Hou YC, Tsai SY, Wen KC, Hsiu SL. Marked decrease ofcyclosporin bioavailability caused by coadministration of ginkgo and onion in rats.Food Chem Toxicol(2006) 44, 1572–8.Ginkgo + DextromethorphanGinkgo does not appear to affect the metabolism of dextro-methorphan.Clinical evidenceGinkgo leaf extract 120 mg twice daily for 16 days was given to 12healthy subjects with a single 30-mg dose of dextromethorphan onday 14. The ginkgo preparation (Ginkgold) contained ginkgoflavonol glycosides 24% and terpene lactones 6%. There was nochange in the metabolism of dextromethorphan when it was takenafter the ginkgo.1In 12 healthy subjects, ginkgo 60 mg four times daily for 28 daysdid not significantly affect the metabolism ofdebrisoquine5 mg.The ginkgo preparation used was standardised to 24% flavoneglycosides and 6% terpene lactones.2These findings were repeatedin a later study using the same criteria in 12 elderly healthy subjects.3Experimental evidenceInin vitroexperiments, low-dose and high-dose ginkgo modestlydecreased and increased the metabolism of dextromethorphan,respectively.4,5MechanismDextromethorphan is used as a probe substrate for the cytochromeP450 isoenzyme CYP2D6, and the study shows that ginkgo has noclinically relevant effect on this isoenzyme. Studies with debriso-quine, another CYP2D6 substrate, also suggest that ginkgo does notaffect CYP2D6.Importance and managementThe available evidence seems to reliably suggest that ginkgo doesnot affect the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan. No action istherefore needed on concurrent use.Dextromethorphan is used as a probe drug for CYP2D6 activity,and therefore these results (along with those for debrisoquine) alsosuggest that a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactionbetween ginkgo and other CYP2D6 substrates is unlikely.1.

However, this effectwas not seen clinically.Importance and managementThe clinical study suggests that ginkgo is unlikely to alter digoxinlevels in clinical use. Therefore no dosage adjustment would beexpected to be necessary if patients taking digoxin also wish to takeginkgo. As digoxin is used as a probe substrate for P-glycoprotein,this study also suggests that ginkgo is unlikely to interact with otherdrugs that are substrates of P-glycoprotein. No action is necessarywith combined use.1. Mauro VF, Mauro LS, Kleshinski JF, Khuder SA, Wang Y, Erhardt PW. Impact ofGinkgo biloba on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.Am J Ther(2003) 10, 247–51.2.

Concurrent use did not affect the pharmacokinetics orcholinesterase activity of donepezil, and cognitive function appearedto be unchanged.1Therefore, over the course of 30 days, concurrentuse appears neither beneficial nor detrimental. No action is necessarywith combined use.1. Yasui-Furukori N, Furukori H, Kaneda A, Kaneko S, Tateishi T. The effects ofGinkgobilobaextracts on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of donepezil.J ClinPharmacol(2004) 44, 538–42.Ginkgo + FexofenadineGinkgo does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics offexofenadine.Evidence, mechanism, importance and managementIn a clinical study, 13 healthy subjects took a single oral dose offexofenadine 120 mg after 4 weeks of twice-daily doses of ginkgo120 mg containing 29% flavonol glycosides and 5% terpenelactones. The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine were not signifi-cantly affected.1Ginkgo213 G"
"Fexofenadine is a P-glycoprotein substrate and the findings of thisstudy therefore suggest that ginkgo does not affect P-glycoproteinactivity. No action is necessary with combined use.1.

For example, in one clinicalstudy, an improvement in positive symptoms was seen in 43schizophrenic patients given ginkgo extract 360 mg daily withhaloperidol 250 micrograms/kg daily for 12 weeks.1This study didnot report any adverse events.Experimental evidenceHigh-dose ginkgo extract (EGb 761,Tebonin®), 80 mg/kg daily for5 days, significantly potentiated the cataleptic adverse effects ofhaloperidol 2 mg/kg given toratson the first and last day.2Thecataleptic response to haloperidol is used as ananimalmodel ofextrapyramidal adverse effects.MechanismUnknown. Haloperidol is a dopamine D2-receptor antagonist. It isthought that ginkgo may interfere with dopamine neurotransmissionby scavenging nitric oxide, which in turn reduces locomotor activity.Importance and managementThe authors of the experimental study caution that there is apossibility of an increase in extrapyramidal effects when ginkgo isused with haloperidol.2However, their study inratsused high doses,and there are clinical studies investigating the addition of ginkgo tohaloperidol that do not mention this adverse effect. Nevertheless, aclinical study specifically of extrapyramidal effects would berequired to investigate this further. It may be prudent to be awareof this possible interaction in case there is an unexpected outcome inpatients taking haloperidol and ginkgo.1. Zhang XY, Zhou DF, Su JM, Zhang PY.

Over the next couple of days she exhibiteda variety of psychotic symptoms including paranoid delusions,disorganised behaviour, anxiety and auditory hallucinations. Herblood-alcohol level was zero on admission and there was noevidence of alcohol withdrawal during her stay in hospital.1Experimental evidenceNo relevant data found.MechanismUnclear. Valerian has been associated with CNS depressant effectswhen given alone and ginkgo is used primarily to improve cognitivefunction and memory loss. Alcohol, valerian and ginkgo were alsoall being withdrawn at the same time. These factors make it difficultto find the exact cause of the psychotic symptoms.Importance and managementThis appears to be the only case report in the literature and, becauseof the multiple factors involved, such as a history of alcohol abuse, itis difficult to assess its general importance. Bear this interaction inmind in case of an adverse response to the combination of ginkgoand valerian.1. Chen D, Klesmer J, Giovanniello A, Katz J. Mental status changes in an alcohol abusertaking valerian and Ginkgo biloba.Am J Addict(2002) 11, 75–7.Ginkgo + NSAIDsAn isolated case describes fatal intracerebral bleeding in apatient taking ginkgo with ibuprofen, and another case describesprolonged bleeding and subdural haematomas in anotherpatient taking gingko and rofecoxib. Studies with diclofenacand flurbiprofen showed that ginkgo had no effect on thepharmacokinetics of these drugs.Clinical evidenceA case of fatal intracerebral bleeding has been reported in a 71-year-old patient taking a ginkgo supplement (Gingium) 4 weeks after hestarted to takeibuprofen600 mg daily.1A 69-year-old man taking aginkgo supplement androfecoxibhad a subdural haematoma after ahead injury, then recurrent small spontaneous haematomas. He wassubsequently found to have a prolonged bleeding time, whichreturned to normal 1 week after stopping the ginkgo supplement androfecoxib, and remained normal after restarting low-doserofecoxib.2A placebo-controlled study in 11 healthy subjects who were givenginkgo leaf (Ginkgold) 120 mg twice daily for three doses, followedby a single 100-mg dose offlurbiprofen, found that thepharmacokinetics offlurbiprofenwere unchanged.3A study in 12 healthy subjects who were givendiclofenac50 mgtwice daily for 14 days, with ginkgo extract (Ginkgold) 120 mg twicedaily on days 8 to 15, found no alteration in the AUC or oralclearance ofdiclofenac.4Experimental evidenceSee Mechanism, below.MechanismThe reason for the bleeding is not known, but ginkgo extractcontains ginkgolide B, which is a potent inhibitor of platelet-activating factorin vitro, which is needed for arachidonate-independent platelet aggregation. However, in one controlled studyin healthy subjects, taking a ginkgo preparation alone for 2 weekshad no effect on platelet function.5Nevertheless, there are casereports of ginkgo supplements, on their own, being associated withprolonged bleeding times,6,7left and bilateral subdural haemat-omas,6,8a right parietal haematoma,9a retrobulbar haemorrhage,10post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy bleeding11and subarachnoidhaemorrhage.7Ibuprofen is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, but214Ginkgo G"
"selective inhibitors of COX-2 such as rofecoxib have no effect onplatelets and would not be expected to potentiate any bleeding effectof ginkgo.The pharmacokinetic studies involving diclofenac and flurbipro-fen were designed to identify whether ginkgo exerted an inhibitoryeffect on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, and confirm thatginkgo has no effect on this isoenzyme.Importance and managementThe evidence from these reports is too slim to forbid patients to takeNSAIDs and ginkgo concurrently, but some do recommendcaution.12Medical professionals should be aware of the possibilityof increased bleeding tendency with ginkgo, and report anysuspected cases.9For other reports of bleeding events with ginkgo see Ginkgo +Antiplatelet drugs, page 209, and Ginkgo + Warfarin and relateddrugs, page 217.1.

Natural health products and adverse reactions.CanAdverse React News(2004) 14, 2–3.Ginkgo + PhenobarbitalThe interaction between ginkgo and phenobarbital is based onexperimental evidence only.Clinical evidenceNo interactions found.Experimental evidenceIn an experimental study inrats, ginkgo extract 0.5% daily (equatingto about 1.3 g/kg) for 2 weeks modestly reduced the maximumserum levels of a single 90-mg/kg dose of phenobarbital by about35%, and reduced the AUC by about 18% (not statisticallysignificant). Conversely, the phenobarbital-induced sleeping timewas reduced markedly from about 8 hours to about 3 hours. Theginkgo extract used was standardised to 24% flavonoids and 9%terpenes.1MechanismGinkgo may induce the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2Bsubfamily, which would increase the metabolism of phenobarbital, aCYP2B6 substrate, and reduce its levels. However, the modestreduction in levels seen with high-dose ginkgo does not explain themarked reduction in sleeping time.Importance and managementThe evidence for this interaction is limited to ananimalstudy andthe doses used are far higher than those used in humans. It istherefore difficult to assess the clinical relevance of this interaction.If anything, it would appear that the interaction may be beneficial(reduced sedation), but this is far from established.For details of possible interactions with other antiepileptics, seeGinkgo + Antiepileptics, page 209.1.

Pretreatment withGinkgo bilobaextract weakens the hypnosis action ofphenobarbital and its plasma concentration in rats.J Pharm Pharmacol(2004) 56,401–5.Ginkgo + PropranololThe interaction between ginkgo and propranolol is based onexperimental evidence only.Clinical evidenceNo interactions found.Experimental evidenceThe maximum serum levels and AUC of propranolol 10 mg/kggiven torats, pretreated with ginkgo extract 100 mg/kg (EGb 761)for 10 days, were reduced by about 40% and 45% respectively whencompared with propranolol alone. The serum levels and AUC of itsmetabolite,N-desisopropylpropranolol, were increased by about70% and 55%. Ginkgo extract 10 mg/kg had no effect.1MechanismThe authors suggested that ginkgo may induce the activity of thecytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, which is one of the majorenzymes involved in the metabolism of propranolol. Ginkgo wouldtherefore reduce the levels of propranolol by inducing its metabol-ism. However, compare caffeine, page 211.Importance and managementThis experiment inratssuggests that high-dose ginkgo mightsignificantly reduce the levels of propranolol by inducing CYP1A2.However, a human study using caffeine as a CYP1A2 probesubstrate found that ginkgo does not affect CYP1A2 to a clinicallyrelevant extent (see Ginkgo + Caffeine, page 211). Therefore aninteraction with propranolol based on this mechanism is unlikely tobe clinically important.1. Zhao L-Z, Huang M, Chen J, Ee PLR, Chan E, Duan W, Guan Y-Y, Hong Y-H, Chen X,Zhou S. Induction of propranolol metabolism byGinkgo bilobaextract EGb 761 in rats.Curr Drug Metab(2006) 7, 577–87.Ginkgo + Protease inhibitorsGinkgo does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics oflopinavir/ritonavir.Clinical evidenceIn a study in 14 healthy subjects, ginkgo 120 mg twice daily for2 weeks had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics oflopinavir/ritonavir400 mg/100 mg twice daily (given for 2 weeksalone before adding the ginkgo). The ginkgo extract was assayedand contained 29% flavonol glycosides and 5% terpene lactones.1Experimental evidenceNo relevant data found.MechanismThe authors suggest that, without ritonavir, the levels of lopinavirwould have been reduced by ginkgo because they also found thatginkgo modestly reduced the levels of midazolam, probably byinducing the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. As ritonavir isan inhibitor of CYP3A4, they suggest that it attenuates the action ofginkgo on lopinavir metabolism. However, note that all proteaseinhibitors are inhibitors of CYP3A4 to varying extents, and note alsothat, in other studies with midazolam, ginkgo had no effect onGinkgo215 G"
"midazolam levels, or even caused a minor increase in levels, whichsuggests that ginkgo does not have a clinically relevant effect onCYP3A4 activity. Consider also Ginkgo + Benzodiazepines,page 210.Importance and managementThe study here shows that ginkgo does not alter the pharmaco-kinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir, and no special precautions arerequired on concurrent use. This would apply to all otherritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors. As regards protease inhibitorsthat are not boosted by ritonavir, the authors of this studyrecommend avoiding ginkgo.1This seems an over-cautiousapproach, given that the sum of studies available shows that ginkgodoes not have a clinically relevant effect on the probe CYP3A4substrate midazolam.1. Robertson SM, Davey RT, Voell J, Formentini E, Alfaro RM, Penzak SR. Effect ofGinkgo bilobaextract on lopinavir, midazolam and fexofenadine pharmacokinetics inhealthy subjects.Curr Med Res Opin(2008) 24, 591–9. Ginkgo + Proton pump inhibitorsGinkgo induces the metabolism of omeprazole. Most otherproton pump inhibitors are likely to be similarly affected.Clinical evidenceIn one study, 18 healthy Chinese subjects were given a single 40-mgdose ofomeprazolebefore and after a 12-day course of astandardised extract of ginkgo 140 mg twice daily. The subjectswere divided into three groups: homozygous extensive CYP2C19metabolisers (6 subjects), heterozygous extensive CYP2C19 meta-bolisers (5) and poor CYP2C19 metabolisers (7). The AUC ofomeprazolewas modestly decreased by 42%, 27% and 40%,respectively, and the plasma levels of the inactive metabolite,hydroxyomeprazole, were increased by 38%, 100% and 232% in thethree groups, respectively. Renal clearance of hydroxyomeprazolewas also reduced by ginkgo.1Experimental evidenceNo relevant data found.MechanismIt was concluded that ginkgo increases the metabolism (hydroxyl-ation) of omeprazole by inducing the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP2C19.Importance and managementThis appears to be the only study examining the effects of ginkgo onproton pump inhibitors. However, the reduction seen in the AUC ofomeprazole (about 40%) suggests that there is a possibility thatomeprazole will be less effective in patients taking ginkgo. As allPPIs are metabolised by CYP2C19 to varying extents, it is likely thatthe effects of ginkgo seen in these studies will be similar with otherPPIs, although note thatrabeprazoleis much less dependent on thisroute of metabolism than other PPIs.There is insufficient evidence to generally recommend that ginkgoshould be avoided in patients taking PPIs. However, the potentialreduction in the efficacy of the PPI should be borne in mind,particular where the consequences may be serious, such as inpatients with healing ulcers.1.

Pharmacogenetics andherb-drug interactions: experience with Ginkgo biloba and omeprazole.Pharmaco-genetics(2004) 14, 841–50.Ginkgo + RisperidoneAn isolated case describes priapism in a patient takingrisperidone and ginkgo.Clinical evidenceA 26-year-old paranoid schizophrenic who had been takingrisperidone 3 mg daily for the past 3 years developed priapism thathad lasted for 4 hours 2 weeks after starting ginkgo 160 mg daily foroccasional tinnitus. The priapism required treatment, and bothginkgo and risperidone were stopped. Risperidone was then restartedand the patient reported no further episodes of priapism at follow-up6 months later.1Experimental evidenceNo relevant data found.MechanismUnclear. Risperidone alone does rarely cause priapism, probablybecause of its alpha-adrenergic properties, and ginkgo might havevascular effects that could be additive. Ginkgo is unlikely to inhibitthe metabolism of risperidone by inhibiting the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP2D6 because it has no clinical effect on otherCYP2D6 substrates. See Ginkgo + Dextromethorphan, page 213.Importance and managementThe use of ginkgo is widespread and this appears to be the onlyreport in the literature of an interaction with risperidone. Its generalrelevance is therefore unclear. Bear it in mind in the event of anunexpected response to treatment.1. Lin Y-Y, Chu S-J, Tsai S-H. Association between priapism and concurrent use ofrisperidone andGinkgo biloba.Mayo Clin Proc(2007) 82, 1288–91.Ginkgo + TheophyllineThe interaction between ginkgo and theophylline is based onexperimental evidence only.Clinical evidenceNo interactions found.Experimental evidenceIn an experimental study inratspretreated with oral ginkgo extract100 mg/kg daily for 5 days, the serum levels and AUC of a single10 mg/kg oral dose of theophylline given on day 6 were reduced byabout 20% and 40%, respectively. The clearance was increased by70%. A less marked effect was seen with ginkgo 10 mg/kg (30%increase in clearance). Similar results were seen with intravenoustheophylline 10 mg/kg.1MechanismThis interaction is thought to be due to the induction of thecytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2 by ginkgo. Theophylline is asubstrate of CYP1A2 and by inducing the activity of this isoenzyme,theophylline is more readily metabolised and cleared from the body.However, ginkgo had no relevant effect on another CYP1A2substrate, caffeine, in humans. See Ginkgo + Caffeine, page 211.Importance and managementThe evidence for this interaction is limited to experimental data andthe dose of ginkgo used is far higher than the most common clinicaldose. A human study using caffeine as a CYP1A2 probe substrate,found that ginkgo does not affect CYP1A2 to a clinically relevant216Ginkgo G"
"extent. Therefore an interaction with theophylline based on thismechanism is unlikely to be clinically important.1. Tang J, Sun J, Zhang Y, Li L, Cui F, He Z. Herb-drug interactions: Effect ofGinkgobilobaextract on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline in rats.Food Chem Toxicol(2007) 45, 2441–5.Ginkgo + TolbutamideGingko does not appear to have a clinically relevant effect on themetabolism or blood-glucose-lowering effects of tolbutamide.Clinical evidenceIn healthy subjects, ginkgo extract (Ginkgold) 120 mg twice daily for7 days had no effect on the urinary metabolic ratio of tolbutamide.1In another study in 10 healthy subjects, ginkgo 360 mg daily for28 days slightly reduced the AUC of a single 125-mg oral dose oftolbutamide by about 16%, with no significant changes in otherpharmacokinetic parameters. The ginkgo product used wasGink-gold, which contained 24% flavone glycosides and 6% terpenelactones. The pharmacodynamics of tolbutamide were not signifi-cantly altered although there was a tendency towards the attenuationof its hypoglycaemic effects by ginkgo (14% reduction).2Experimental evidenceIn an experimental study, ginkgo 32 mg/kg given daily for 5 daysbefore a single 40-mg/kg dose of tolbutamide significantly reducedits blood-glucose-lowering effects in agedrats. However, when asingle 100-mg/kg dose of ginkgo was given with a single 40-mg/kgdose of tolbutamide, the blood-glucose levels were significantlylower, when compared with tolbutamide alone, suggesting thatginkgo potentiated the blood-glucose-lowering effects of tolbut-amide.3MechanismIt was suggested that ginkgo might induce the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP2C9, by which tolbutamide is metabolised. How-ever, the clinical study shows that ginkgo has little or no clinicallyrelevant effect on CYP2C9. The disparate effects between single andmultiple dose administration in theanimalstudy are not understood.Importance and managementFrom the clinical evidence, it is clear that ginkgo has little, if any,effect on the metabolism and blood-glucose-lowering effects oftolbutamide. A clinically relevant interaction therefore seemsunlikely.Tolbutamide is used as a probe drug for CYP2C9 activity, andtherefore these results also suggest that a clinically relevantpharmacokinetic interaction between ginkgo and other CYP2C9substrates is unlikely.1.

The patient woke immediately after being givenflumazenil 1 mg intravenously.1Experimental evidenceNo relevant data found.MechanismIt was suggested that the flavonoids in the ginkgo had a subclinicaldirect effect on the benzodiazepine receptor. In addition, it wassuggested that ginkgo increased the metabolism of trazodone to itsactive metabolite, 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) by thecytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. The increased levels of themetabolite were thought to have enhanced the release of GABA(γ-aminobutyric acid). Flumazenil may have blocked the directeffect of the flavonoids, thus causing the GABA activity to fallbelow the level required to have a clinical effect. However, note thatclinically relevant CYP3A4 induction has not been seen with theconventional CYP3A4 probe substrate midazolam. See Ginkgo +Benzodiazepines, page 210.Importance and managementEvidence for an interaction between ginkgo and trazodone appearsto be limited to this isolated case, from which no general conclusionscan be drawn. Bear this interaction in mind in case of an unexpectedresponse to concurrent use.1. Galluzzi S, Zanetti O, Binetti G, Trabucchi M, Frisoni GB. Coma in a patient withAlzheimer’s disease taking low dose trazodone and ginkgo biloba.J Neurol NeurosurgPsychiatry(2000) 68, 679–80.Ginkgo + Warfarin and related drugsEvidence from pharmacological studies in patients and healthysubjects suggests that ginkgo does not usually interact withwarfarin. However, an isolated report describes intracerebralhaemorrhage associated with the use of ginkgo and warfarin,and there are a few reports of bleeding associated with the use ofginkgo alone.Clinical evidenceIn a randomised, crossover study in 21 patients stabilised onwarfarin, ginkgo extract 100 mg daily (Bio-Biloba) for 4 weeks didnot alter the INR or the required dose ofwarfarin, when comparedwith placebo.1Similarly, in another study in healthy subjects,2Tavonin(containing standardised dry extract EGb 761 of ginkgoequivalent to 2 g of leaf) two tablets three times daily for 2 weeks didnot affect either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (INR)of a single dose ofwarfaringiven on day 7. Moreover, aretrospective review of 21 clinical cases involving the concurrentuse of ginkgo andwarfarinalso found no evidence of altered INRs.3Conversely, a report describes an intracerebral haemorrhage,which occurred in an elderly woman within 2 months of her startingto take ginkgo. Her prothrombin time was found to be 16.9 secondsand her partial thromboplastin time was 35.5 seconds. She had beentakingwarfarinuneventfully for 5 years.4The author of the reportspeculated that ginkgo may have contributed towards the haemor-rhage.Experimental evidenceInanimalstudies it was found that the AUC ofwarfarinwasdecreased by 23.4% when the ginkgo extract EGb 761 was given,and the prothrombin time was also reduced by EGb 761, whichwould suggest that ginkgo shouldreducethe effects ofwarfarin.3MechanismUncertain. Isolated cases of bleeding have been reported with ginkgoalone (which have been the subject of a review5). In pharmacologicalstudies, ginkgo extract alone did not alter coagulation parameters orplatelet aggregation.2,3Moreover, the experimental study suggeststhat ginkgo might reduce the effects of warfarin.

"also do not appear to affect the metabolism of a number of substratesof the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, suggesting that apharmacokinetic interaction with warfarin, which is metabolised bythis route, is unlikely. Consider also Ginkgo + NSAIDs, page 214,and Ginkgo + Tolbutamide, page 217.Importance and managementThere is good evidence from pharmacological studies in patients andhealthy subjects that ginkgo extract would not be expected tointeract with warfarin. However, there is one case report of over-anticoagulation, and a few reports of bleeding with ginkgo alone.This is insufficient evidence to justify advising patients takingwarfarin to avoid ginkgo,but they should be warned to monitor forearly signs of bruising or bleeding and seek informed professionaladvice if any bleeding problems arise.Consider also Ginkgo + Antiplatelet drugs, page 209, and Ginkgo+ NSAIDs, page 214 for other reports of bleeding events.1.
