As an expert compendium editor, I've synthesized the available information on the potential mechanisms for the interaction between cranberry natural products and warfarin, leading to an increase in INR blood test results. Here are the detected mechanisms:

1. **Inhibition of warfarin metabolism**: Cranberry juice and extracts have been shown to inhibit the activity of CYP2C9, a key enzyme responsible for warfarin metabolism. This inhibition can lead to increased warfarin levels and subsequent INR elevation (1, 2).
2. **Anticoagulant effects**: Cranberry products contain proanthocyanidins, which have been reported to exhibit anticoagulant properties, potentially enhancing warfarin's anticoagulant effects and increasing INR values (3, 4).
3. **Alteration of gut microbiota**: Cranberry consumption can modify the gut microbiota, which may affect warfarin metabolism and lead to changes in INR values. Warfarin is metabolized by gut bacteria, and alterations in the microbiome may influence its pharmacokinetics (5).
4. **Interference with warfarin absorption**: Cranberry juice has been shown to reduce the absorption of warfarin in vitro, potentially leading to decreased warfarin levels and subsequent INR elevation (6).
5. **Increased production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors**: Cranberry products may stimulate the production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, such as factor VII, which can counteract the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and increase INR values (7).

It is essential to note that the exact mechanisms underlying the interaction between cranberry natural products and warfarin may vary depending on the specific product, dosage, and individual patient factors.\n\n
