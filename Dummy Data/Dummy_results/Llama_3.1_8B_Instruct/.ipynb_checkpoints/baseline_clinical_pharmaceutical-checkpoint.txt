------------------

Based on available research, the potential mechanisms that may cause an interaction between cranberry products and warfarin, leading to an increased International Normalized Ratio (INR), are:

1. Inhibition of warfarin metabolism: Cranberry products may inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C9, which is responsible for the metabolism of warfarin. This inhibition could lead to increased warfarin levels and an increased risk of bleeding (1, 2).
2. Alteration of warfarin absorption: Cranberry products may alter the absorption of warfarin by affecting the gut microbiome, which could lead to changes in warfarin's pharmacokinetic profile and increased INR (3).
3. Anticoagulant effects: Cranberry products may have anticoagulant properties, which could enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and increase the risk of bleeding (4).

	+ Known names: Cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, American cranberry, and others.
	+ Administration routes: Oral, often in the form of juice, supplements, or capsules.
	+ Average amount of bioactive compounds: Varies depending on the product, but typically contains 10-50 mg of anthocyanins and other bioactive compounds per serving.

**Warfarin:**

* Brief description: Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant medication used to prevent and treat thrombosis and embolism.

	+ Known names: Coumadin, Jantoven, and others.
	+ Administration routes: Oral.
	+ Standardized dosage: 2-5 mg/day, with a narrow therapeutic range of 2-10 ng/mL.

**Adverse Event:**

* Description: Increased INR and bleeding risk due to the interaction between cranberry products and warfarin.
* Onset time: The onset of bleeding due to this interaction is typically within 1-2 weeks of starting cranberry products (9).
* Likelihood of overlapping effects: The risk of bleeding is increased when warfarin and cranberry products are co-administered, especially in patients with a history of bleeding or those taking other anticoagulant medications.
* Potential additive nature: The anticoagulant effects of warfarin and cranberry products may be additive, increasing the risk of bleeding.

**Clinical Importance:**

* Frequency of mention: The interaction between cranberry products and warfarin has been mentioned in several studies and review articles, indicating a potential clinical importance.
* Clinical significance: The interaction may lead to increased bleeding risk and INR, which can have serious consequences, especially in patients with a history of bleeding or those taking other anticoagulant medications.

**Other Drugs:**

* Other anticoagulant medications, such as vitamin K antagonists (e.g., phenprocoumon), may also interact with cranberry products and increase the risk of bleeding.
* Other natural products, such as garlic, ginger, and turmeric, may also interact with warfarin and increase the risk of bleeding, although the evidence is less robust.
