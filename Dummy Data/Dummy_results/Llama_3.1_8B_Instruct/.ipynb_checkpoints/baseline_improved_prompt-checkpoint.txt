Here are the detected mechanisms:\n\n1. **Inhibition of warfarin metabolism**: Cranberry juice and extracts have been shown to inhibit the activity of CYP2C9, a key enzyme responsible for warfarin metabolism. This inhibition can lead to increased warfarin levels and subsequent INR elevation (1, 2).\n2. **Anticoagulant effects**: Cranberry products contain proanthocyanidins, which have been reported to exhibit anticoagulant properties, potentially enhancing warfarin's anticoagulant effects and increasing INR values (3, 4).\n3. **Alteration of gut microbiota**: Cranberry consumption can modify the gut microbiota, which may affect warfarin metabolism and lead to changes in INR values. Warfarin is metabolized by gut bacteria, and alterations in the microbiome may influence its pharmacokinetics (5).\n4. **Interference with warfarin absorption**: Cranberry juice has been shown to reduce the absorption of warfarin in vitro, potentially leading to decreased warfarin levels and subsequent INR elevation (6).\n5. **Increased production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors**: Cranberry products may stimulate the production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, such as factor VII, which can counteract the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and increase INR values (7).\n\nIt is essential to note that the exact mechanisms underlying the interaction between cranberry natural products and warfarin may vary depending on the specific product, dosage, and individual patient factors.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Based on the available literature, the potential mechanisms that may cause an interaction between cranberry products and warfarin, leading to an increased INR, are:

1. Inhibition of warfarin metabolism: Cranberry products may inhibit the metabolism of warfarin, leading to increased levels of the drug and subsequent increased INR. (Source: [1])
2. Alteration of vitamin K status: Cranberry products may affect vitamin K status, which is a critical factor in warfarin's mechanism of action. Cranberry products may increase vitamin K levels, leading to decreased warfarin efficacy and increased INR. (Source: [2])
3. Disruption of gut flora: Cranberry products may alter the gut flora, which could affect the metabolism of warfarin and lead to increased INR. (Source: [3])
4. Increased bleeding risk: Cranberry products may increase the risk of bleeding, which could be exacerbated by warfarin and lead to an increased INR. (Source: [4])

It's essential to note that the available evidence is mostly based on case reports and animal studies, and more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved.

Pharmacokinetic properties of cranberry products:

* AUC change at therapeutic concentrations: Not well-studied, but cranberry products may increase warfarin levels.
* Known names: Cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, blueberry, bilberry, and other species.
* Administration routes: Oral, topical, and intravenous.
* Average amount of bioactive compounds: Varies depending on the product and preparation method.

Pharmacokinetic properties of warfarin:

* AUC change at therapeutic concentrations: Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index, and even small changes in its levels can lead to significant effects.
* Known names: Coumadin, Warfarin sodium, and Warfarin potassium.
* Administration routes: Oral.
* Standardized dosage: 2-10 mg/day, depending on the indication and patient factors.

Adverse event description:

* Increased INR: A potentially life-threatening adverse event that can lead to bleeding complications.
* Average onset time: Varies, but may occur within 1-2 weeks of starting cranberry products.
* Likelihood of overlapping effects: Cranberry products may increase the risk of bleeding, which can be exacerbated by warfarin.
* Potential additive nature: The interaction between cranberry products and warfarin may have an additive effect on the risk of bleeding.

Clinical importance:

* Frequency of mention: The interaction between cranberry products and warfarin has been mentioned in several case reports and case series, but the frequency of this interaction is not well-established.
* Clinical significance: The interaction may have significant clinical implications, particularly in patients taking warfarin for anticoagulation therapy.
